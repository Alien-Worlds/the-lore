> *"Life is the way the universe speaks to us... And now we can speak back."* ---Notes from a Trilium Researcher
  
Elsewhere in the galaxy, far into the future, the Altans - an elder, superior race - discovered Trilium on their home planet. In its raw state, Trilium was the most bio-reactive substance known. When exposed to genetic material, it caused mutations and alterations at an unparalleled rate, wreaking chaos in the genetic code. The Altans sought to understand the effects of Trilium and eventually mastered its power and possibilities, developing Triactor technology that allowed them to safely and precisely administer Trilium on themselves. This was a genetic Pandora’s Box for their race.

The Altans used Trilium and Triactor Technology to eliminate disease, genetic defects, and even slow down aging - but there was a catch: its effects were only temporary. Without constant exposure to Trilium, any genetic aging and disease would re-emerge. For the Altans, Trilium and Triactor Tech stood between where life & death met, and because it was so vital, offering seemingly limitless possibilities, the number of use cases grew exponentially.  The realization that it was a limited resource and would inevitably run out eventually dawned upon the Altans, and as a superior race who valued their cognitive prowess beyond all else, they understood well the repercussions of losing this substance that had become such an ubiquitous part of their civilization.

After a few skirmishes and growing turmoil as factions fought for control of the dwindling supplies, the Altans knew they needed to find other sources of Trilium. So they turned to the stars - and that too required Trilium, so they could modify themselves to survive on other worlds in other environments. The Altans used their Triactor technology as they journeyed outward in every direction, in the beginning of what was later termed “The Great Expansion”. It was not merely a desperate search for Trilium however, but also a quest to build a galactic consortium. During their search, the Altans found many other intelligent races including the Humans of Earth, and they shared some facets of their knowledge freely.

The other races found they could apply Triactor Tech to their species as well, offering such benefits as enhanced physical abilities, the ability to survive on alien worlds and the extension of their lifespans. Thus, as the consortium - the Federation - grew, so did its appetite for Trilium and Triactor Technology.

Trilium has thus far been found in substantial quantities on six other planets: Eyeke, Kavian, Magor, Naron, Neri, Veles. Some of these sources were discovered by the Altans, while others were found by different races as the expansion continued and galactic civilization grew more intertwined among the major civilizations. Commercial entities that exploit Trilium sources and modify Triactor tech have become the most powerful economic forces in the federation.

In the current time the Federation is a vast, pan-galactic entity run by Megacorps and other vested interests, with powerful Syndicates controlling the major Trilium extraction operations on the six planets. Meanwhile, the search for other Trilium deposits continues at a breakneck pace across countless star systems.

While numerous races and life forms have been discovered across these alien worlds, the primary players - in addition to the original ancient Altan race - are the Elgems, Khaureds, Onoros,  Lopati, Humans and the Robotrons (whose status in the Federation remains unclear). These races interact in countless ways via business endeavors, conflicts, alliances, and schemes with various goals both virtuous and nefarious in nature. The search for other worlds, other races - and other sources of Trilium - continues to expand across the galaxy.

## TRILIUM
Trilium is an innately formless energy source with a chaotic resonance discovered by the Altans which adapts naturally to its surroundings, and is classified as the most bioreactive substance in the known universe, causing runaway mutation whenever it comes into direct contact with organic matter. It is known to exist in solid, liquid, or gas states depending on the terrain from which it is extracted. Its constant energy emission is harnessed through artificially constraining its frequency, enabling versatile applications such as augmentation through bionetics & cybernetics, deep space travel, and genetic modifications related to health - particularly disease resistance and eradication - physiological performance, telomeric reconstruction (aiding longevity), and innovative adaptations that facilitate survival in biomes otherwise hostile to life.

The Altans, experimenting with Trilium in various states, identified specific strengths for each, with gaseous Trilium excelling as a technology power source, liquid Trilium as ideal for bionetics, and granulated solid Trilium - suspended in a stabilizing gel - used in genetic modulation.

### Introducing Triactor Technology
Trilium's volatility varies across states, with gaseous Trilium being the most volatile and having extreme mutagenic effects on any organic matter that it comes into contact with. Altans developed a refining method to lock Trilium into specific stable states and constrain its resonance frequency, identifying distinct resonances for power and genetic modification.

Triactor Technology underpins the ability to manipulate refined Trilium in useful ways, tapping into various resonances related to the recipient's race, individual characteristics, residing planet, and desired genetic modifications. Using appropriate tools and containment methods, raw Trilium can be mined and transported safely to official refineries, where it is then converted into specific locked states for different technological applications. In combination with the Altans' Triactor Technology it unlocks a spectrum of possibilities in harnessing energy, genetics, and technology.
### Triactor Jacks
The most prolific use of Triactor Technology is personal: a Triactor socket grafted onto a living organism into which genetic modulation cartridges can be slotted. These cartridges contain the three core states of refined Trilium, separated in a triangular fashion. The Triactor socket takes a reading of the organism to determine its base resonance state, and once read an array of possibilities will become available – a library of sorts along with risks and repeat applications.

Diseases, wounds, and almost all other ailments possess a particular repeating resonance. A fitted Triactor jack can be programmed to locate and identify these resonance patterns within an organism, and then calculate & administer the exact curative resonance required to heal the problem area. The jack’s abilities extend beyond curative medical applications, and can be utilized to alter or enhance an individual both physically and mentally.
### Data Cores
In order to elicit a particular desired effect a data core must be inserted into the central cavity of the Triactor jack. This core contains a specific set of genetic instructions which guide the Triactor’s augmentation of the host organism, preventing unwanted side effects and ensuring the alteration process is as power-efficient as possible.

As more data are gathered on the different Federation races and the various medical issues that they can succumb to, the array of previously incurable disease, poisons and other negative bodily influences that Triactor technology is capable of dealing with continues to grow. In addition, the list of potential enhancements likewise grows longer with more complex beneficial augmentation becoming possible over time.

### Trilium and Weaponsmithing
In the early period after the creation of the Federation when the first of the Frontier planets was discovered, colonists quickly found that the blaster weapons they typically used to protect themselves against predators functioned erratically or not at all. The Altans tested numerous theories and found conclusive evidence that Trilium’s fluctuating resonance destabilized the energy produced when charging or trying to fire a blaster, resulting in misfire, rapid dissipation, or in the worst case scenario disintegration of the weapon itself (and likely whoever was holding it). This meant that anyone using Triactor technology, powered as it was by Trilium fuel cells, was incapable of utilizing such weapons - and also were incapable of being harmed by them as their proximity to Trilium caused any energy bolts to dissipate before making contact.

With no foreseeable workaround for the problem the fledgling Federation Congress voted to  abandon the development of personal and planet-side blaster weaponry, and individuals in need of offensive weapons were relegated to more traditional staples such as swords and projectile-firing guns.
#### Biometal
A monastic sect of Altans on the planet of Eyeke - known colloquially as “Greys” owing to their light greyish skin tone and the muted colors of both their clothing and their settlements, and renowned for creating all manner of weaponry from Waxon, the toughest mineral known and very hard to mine or shape without using specially tailored cutting technology - began to experiment attempting to infuse Waxon and other metals with Trilium in order to enhance the properties of the final product. These experiments were ultimately successful with the resultant alloys possessing a modicum of Trilium’s extreme bioreactivity, and capable of causing unpredictable rapid onset genetic mutation to any organic material that they came into contact with. Given such mutagenic properties, these alloys were named “biometals”.
#### M-Casters & Biometal Forgemasters
The Eyekese Altans forged their new biometals into a variety of bladed weapons including daggers, axes and particularly swords. The process of forging such items was costly, time-consuming, and incredibly hazardous, so only the best of the Altan smiths were permitted to carry out what they termed Biometal manipulation. Collectively they were referred to as Biometal Forgemasters - or colloquially as Splicers - and the special weapons they produced were given the umbrella name of M-Casters.

Not content with the randomized effects caused to opponents by Trilium-infused alloys, the Forgemasters sought mastery over Biometal’s mutagenic properties, modifying Triactor technology to allow it to be applied to the shaft or handle of a weapon and thus restrain Trilium’s chaotic resonance in a similar way as when applied to individuals. This facilitated the creation of a suite of weapons with very specific properties, including the legendary Galactic Fireblade - a bastard sword forged with a liquid core of Trilium-infused lava from the famous Azingoth volcano on Magor - and the brightly-glowing Star Fire Sword - a shortsword purportedly created from an alloy including an unknown metallic element found in a meteorite crater.
#### The Sandmasters of Neri
A notable early client of the Splicers was a Nerinese Syndicate made up of a group of desert tribes. After centuries of war and attrition, the tribes had come together to present a unified front in the face of the arrival of Federation Syndicates and Megacorps seeking to colonize Neri, and exploit its varied resources - particularly Trilium - for their own gain. Setting aside grievances passed down through generations for so long that the true origins of the rift-causing disagreements between tribes were lost to history, the Sandmasters’ Syndicate built itself into a force to be reckoned with.

As an enduring, ritualistic sign of their unity, they sent an ambassador to the Altans of Eyeke to request the manufacture of a set of special Biometal spears, containing rare and precious grains of soul sand from the sacred temple that members of all tribes often made pilgrimages to, and where the creation of the Sandmasters’ Syndicate had taken place. The Altans agreed, and though the cost was steep, a spear was forged for each tribal leader. These Sandmaster Spears are said to be capable of commanding the sands of the Nerinese desert itself, and incidences of sandstorms springing up seemingly out of nowhere to hinder Megacorp convoys and encroaching groups from other Syndicates, are attributed to use of this power by the Sandmasters.
#### The Necromancers' Guild
Another organization that immediately saw potential in the invention of Biometals was the famous Necromancers’ Guild, a multi-racial group dedicated solely to finding a method of reversing death itself. They viewed Trilium as the fundamental key not just to reanimation of the dead, but truly bringing them back to life. Their activities were viewed with wariness, and the Altans in particular - having a wealth of experience experimenting with Trilium and dealing with many unwanted or unprecedented side effects - monitored them closely.

Over a period of decades, wealthy members of the Necromancers’ Guild approached the Splicers with blueprints of what they deemed “fatality reversal devices”, which were in fact a variety of weapons infused with Trilium and concoctions of different elements, the particulars of which the Guild guarded incredibly closely - and the Splicers kept to themselves for reasons beyond mere client confidentiality. 

The stories of these weapons being employed in attempts to bring the dead back to life abound across the Federation - notably because none of them actually function as designed, though they possess impressive capabilities nonetheless - with tales such as that of the Necromancers’ Hammer being used to try to reanimate one of the fabled Storm Giants, whispers of an M-Caster known as the Dagger of Creation capable of creating a temporary simulacrum of the wielder out of molten lava, and revelations about the powerful curative properties of the Healing Blade best the most widely disseminated. In spite of their failures, the Necromancers cling doggedly to their quest “to master the mystery that is death”, as their official Guild slogan reads.
#### Ranged Weapons: R-Casters
Enterprising individuals across the Federation saw Biometal not just as material for producing close combat weaponry, but also a new evolution of ranged weapons capable of inflicting genetic devastation from a safe distance. Lacking access to the refined techniques and advanced technology utilized by the Splicers, several organizations have nonetheless managed to design crude Biometal production mechanisms, and also methods of melting down existing Biometal weapons, using both to produce a range of Trilium-infused bullets & arrow/bolt-heads, and a series of necessarily reinforced guns, bows and crossbows - known collectively as R-Casters - capable of firing them with some degree of reliability and accuracy. 

The ammo lacks the Triactor technology that restrains and guides the mutagenic impact of Trilium, and as such the effects on living organisms are unpredictable. R-casters are also somewhat prone to issues of instability, owing to the fact that the Trilium infusion process is being carried out using inferior technology, and there are gruesome reports of explosive misfires causing entire military squads to die horrifically as runaway mutation wrought havoc on their bodies.

Various factions within the Federation - including the Altans - disdain the use of such technology. However, other powerful factions such as the Khaureds routinely equip their military with R-casters, arguing that in scenarios where they are protecting land-based convoys or conducting ground assaults, ranged weapons are more effective at getting the job done successfully, and in spite of the instability issues are generally better at guaranteeing the lives of the Khaured soldiers & mercenaries wielding them.
## THE PRIMARY RACES
### ALTANS
The Altans are the most advanced Federation race. They were the apex species on a utopian planet with no competitive pressures. This allowed them to focus on developing their minds, and look towards the greater goal of understanding the universe. They evolved in harmony with nature, developing a deep scientific knowledge of organic structures down to the microscopic level, seeing this as the key to understanding the greater whole.

They are typically tall and willowy with large, top-heavy ovoid heads, slightly enlarged eyes with acute vision, and delicate, elongated fingers that allow them to work with incredible precision. They are not a powerfully muscular species, owing to the fact that they never had to compete physically with other organisms on their home planet.

Altan society is hierarchical in nature, with individual status indicated by the complexity and visible display of operational Triactor technology. Altans of lower status typically wear more concealing clothing than their higher peers, with the most powerful Altans wearing clothing that is more ritualistic in nature and conceals very little of their genetically enhanced bodies.

Triactor-derived head paraphernalia are incredibly popular amongst Altans - with a wide variety of designs ranging from commonplace to unique and unusual - and are believed to enhance one or more of their basic senses in addition to their naturally powerful intellect. The complexity of these head adornments is perhaps the most visible marker of status among Altans.

Various other facets of Altan fashion are an homage to their reserved culture and penchant for maintaining an appreciable area of personal space, including such dress items as long-sleeved gloves or gauntlets with large protrusions - particularly near the elbow - that emphasize the notion that they are not to be approached too closely.
#### Architecture
Altan cities are comprised primarily of massive structures with a large amount of open, green space. The buildings combine overarching organic curves with intricate detailing, typically conforming to one or more of three primary shapes: arch, leaf & triangle.

They are capable of constructing their settlements on any terrain, easily adapting the buildings and layouts to suit the location without compromising the fundamental facets of their architectural style. Visitors to Altan cities are often left in awe of the architectural prowess on display, marveling at their ability to create gargantuan monuments whilst maintaining a sense of harmony with the natural surroundings.

The central interior spaces of most buildings are open to all and convey a feeling of vastness with incredibly high ceilings, whilst private living areas are located off these main atria. Altans typically mingle with each other and members of other races in these central spaces, with their personal dwellings being off limits to all but their closest family and allies.

Altan technology is semi-organic in nature and integrated seamlessly into all of their buildings, with heavy emphasis being placed upon complex functionality without compromising the flowing elegance of their architecture.
#### Vehicles
The Altans have mastered the power of flight and interstellar travel, and as such no longer both with ground vehicles at all. They largely utilize their ships as a means of transport or remote scientific enquiry, dedicating very few to combat-centric roles. All of their vessels have a semi-organic structure with smooth, seamless paneling, and range in size from tiny, short range personal transports, to gargantuan interstellar freighters and city-sized orbital platforms.

There is a great deal of visual variety across Altan vehicles in terms of shape, though they all possess common factors that make them readily distinguishable from the craft of other races. Perhaps the highest level of variation is seen amongst personal transports, with Altans creating unique chassis as symbols of fashion and status.

They possess the skill and capacity to build space-faring vessels of a size no other Federation race - bar the Lopati, whose mastery of ship-building rivals that of the Altans - is capable of reliably matching, owing to the fact that they were the first known race to begin large-scale exploration and colonization of the cosmos, branching out from Alta in search of new sources of Trilium.

Altans feel a strong sense of security when it comes to the advanced state of their technology compared to other races, and thus commit few of their resources to arming their vessels. This of course does not mean they lack any military fleet at all, though Altan warships remain an incredibly rare sight within the Federation’s borders.
### ELGEMS
The Elgem are one of the oldest Federation races boasting technology on par with the Khaured and only surpassed by the Altans, yet their presence is muted. They do not crave wealth, power or fame but instead prefer to fade into the background, content with having a seat at the Federation table but uninterested in the intricate dance of interstellar politics.

Their skeletal structure is more cartilage than bone, allowing them to fit into inconceivably tight spaces if they choose - making them the perfect infiltrators or assassins. They typically have smooth, almost ageless facial features and pointed ears that can vary in size based on tribe and family lineage.Their hair is an unruly mass threaded with organic flowerlike accouterments that are actually living parts of their bodies.

These biological paraphernalia can be furled and unfurled at will, and are vibrantly coloured when in the latter state - which only occurs when they are in places where they feel at ease. When abroad - either on mission or mingling with unknown members of other races - the accouterments close up tightly to help minimize their visible presence.

There are two inarguably distinct sides to Elgem culture, and they adopt one version or the other depending upon the situation. Whilst among their own people and in places they deem “safe” they tend to be relaxed and innately frolicsome, whilst in the presence of strangers or far from their homes they are quiet and reserved, blending into the background, their short stature aiding their ability to remain unnoticed by most. Their clothing is selected to match their situation, with muted colors and hooded cloaks chosen when abroad, whilst at home their vestments border on garish, with prodigious use of vibrant colors.
#### Architecture
Whilst highly intelligent and agile, the Elgem are not in fact the apex predator on their home planet, a title reserved for a strange, amorphous entity that blankets the ground on their homeworld like a living mist. It is swift, deadly, and any Elgem enveloped by it is dead within moments. As such their settlements are built among the high boughs of gargantuan trees, and are uniquely adapted to the various issues associated with tree-top life.

They have accounted for aerodynamics, weight distribution and the need to minimize the load any individual tree has to bear, giving rise to communities compromising interconnected structures made of incredibly light, yet durable materials that spread the load across many trees. They navigate these communities via a plethora of walkways and specially designed zip-cables (known colloquially as “wizzers”) that use advanced energy flow technology to transport Elgem quickly from one part of their settlement to another.

The interiors of Elgem buildings are designed to harmonize with the natural surroundings, comprising an organic, mushroom-esque architectural style and a decorative aesthetic that incorporates a lot of plant life into the interior space, often leading to a somewhat overgrown look. Evidence of Elgem technological prowess is evident everywhere when one looks closely however, with the vast majority of furniture and other necessities being constructed of advanced ultra-light materials that help to minimize the overall load that their buildings have to bear.

Those few privileged outsiders who have witnessed Elgem settlements firsthand state that their charm lies not only in their whimsical appearance, but also in the seamless integration of advanced technology into every aspect of their design and function. This unique blend of nature-driven artistry and innovation creates an environment that is equal parts delightful and deeply practical, a reflection of the Elgem ability to balance the playful and the profound.
#### Vehicles
Elgem technology is the embodiment of their unique cultural duality, exhibiting an exquisite vibrancy in its coloration when their ships traverse through recognized safe zones or engage in diplomatic endeavors. This vivid display of colors is not merely an aesthetic choice but a reflection of their openness and harmony with their surroundings in such environments. However, the technology reveals its true ingenuity when discretion becomes paramount. In scenarios necessitating stealth, their ships are capable of achieving a level of camouflage that no other Federation race can match, allowing them to move undetected.

The design of their ships draws inspiration from the natural world, echoing the elegant and often deceptive simplicity found in nature's creations. These vessels are adorned with an innovative bio-organic skin that employs chromatophores to dynamically alter the ship’s coloration. This feature enables the Elgem to adapt their vessel’s appearance at will, akin to the ability of various cephalopods to change their skin colouration and patterning according to the situation. The skin also does more than just change color; it has the ability to modify or mask various signatures that would otherwise be detectable by advanced scanning technologies.

It is important to note that this sophisticated mechanism of camouflage does not equate to true invisibility. Instead it is a highly advanced form of mimicry and masking where the ship blends into its environment, becoming virtually indistinguishable from it. This feature represents one of the pinnacles of Elgem technological advancement, and its duality - both vibrant and discreet - is a testament to their deep understanding of balance and adaptability, reflecting their cultural ethos.
### KHAUREDS
Khaureds are aptly evolved to handle the high gravity and various airborne gaseous hazards of their home planet of Khaur. Typically a stocky race with thick, pebbly skin that acts as a natural body armor, protecting them from attacks and various phenomena such as caustic gasses, and their densely packed musculature - owing to the high gravity environment in which they evolved - makes them physically powerful compared to most other Federation races. They are the only race to possess a third eye in the center of their forehead, which remains closed at most times but will open during periods of intense physical or spiritual focus.

Whilst they make excellent mercenaries and bodyguards, culturally they are incredibly focused, driven by a strong sense of purpose. As such, before a Khaured will commit to a contract - or anything that requires their services - they must be convinced that the job is worth doing. They do not simply go with the highest bidder, they will assess the the worthiness of the cause they’re being employed for; if hired as mercenaries to fight a war, they must be convinced that the war is worth fighting, or to be contracted as bodyguards for a powerful ambassador, they must be persuaded that the ambassador merits their protection. Therefore, those seeking to hire the services of a Khaured must have an excellent “sales pitch”.

Female Khaureds tend to be the brokers and negotiators, whilst males are more physically oriented - though this does not preclude there being crossover between the two sexes in terms of the roles that they perform. As a species, they are renowned as strong and relentless fighters, preferring to use hand weapons and engage in close combat - though they are also excellent marksmen thanks to the additional depth perception and triangulation capability offered by their third eye. They are almost universally cool-headed in combat making them deadly opponents that are rarely goaded into mistakes or rash action.

In terms of politics Khaureds are dedicated and intensely loyal, driven to excel at their aims. This makes them a powerful political force in the Federation, though they prefer facts and bluntness to misdirection or intrigue. They often end up being a jarring presence, interrupting the otherwise delicate dance of interstellar politics, though when Khaureds are involved things at least tend to get done (for better or worse). They are implacable and ruthless when it comes to business as well, driven by the incessant need to see ever-increasing success and measuring themselves against their peers in an ongoing battle of dedicative prowess.

An element of Khaured society bridles against the ruthless and driven aspects of their race, instead exploring creativity, philosophy and various other intellectual endeavors. These individuals have created their own sect and retreated from wider Khaured society, building fabulous communities and monasteries high in the mountains far from civilization, their intricacy and beauty a stark juxtaposition to the blocky, brutalist architecture of typical Khaured towns and cities.

Rumour has it that the spiritual Khaureds have vast, ancient libraries in their mountain retreats, along with artworks of such ethereal beauty that only those who have reached a certain level of spiritual enlightenment may look upon them, lest they be struck blind or driven mad. In order to achieve such an enlightened state, Khaured gurus spend many years with only their third central eye open, attuning themselves through it to higher planes of existence. The closer to enlightenment that they are, the milkier the third eye becomes - though this is not through advancing blindness, but a change that enables sight beyond the corporeal.
#### Architecture
The gravity on Khaur is such that the Khaureds were forced to create robust structures lacking typical decorative paraphernalia found across the architectural styles of other races. This coupled with their penchant for function over form and general lack of artistic drive, has resulted in a brutalist style of architecture that looms imposingly over the landscape. Typical Khaured structures are akin to fortresses, thick-walled and constructed from highly durable materials.

The hard, brutalist lines of Khaured architecture carry through into their building interiors, and like the exteriors there are no unnecessary frills. Everything inside a Khaured building must serve some sort of purpose, and as such even the private quarters of Khaured individuals lack much in the way of decoration. The one exception to this is owing to the deep-seated need to show pride in their accomplishments, hence most Khaureds have a personal display case where they keep trophies from their endeavors, the majority of which are weapons or select parts taken from vanquished foes.

Spiritualist Khaureds seek to be the exception to the regimented, soulless norms of their race in every way, including their approach to architecture. Whilst they cannot completely eschew the need for robust construction, and likewise are unable to add fragile decorations to the outside of their buildings, they seek to add as much artistic flair to the construction of their buildings as possible. Visually they are still immediately recognizable as Khaured, but grander and with attention paid to details that beautify their form.

These Spiritualist retreats are also built in areas deemed to be of great natural beauty, whereas typical Khaureds pay no attention to such things, instead strictly reviewing the tactical pros and cons of the terrain upon which they wish to build.

The interiors of Spiritualist citadels are spacious and structurally detailed, with generous use of what - to Khaureds at least - are deemed as vibrant colors, and placement of artworks where possible. There is still a practicality to these interiors, but they strive to be warm, welcoming and appealing to the eye. There are public spaces where Khaureds are encouraged to gather, socialize and enjoy a much more varied cuisine than could ever be found in a typical Khaured city. There are also areas dedicated purely to spiritual cultivation, designed to offer a tranquil environment for would-be gurus to achieve mastery over the ethereal plane.
#### Vehicles
The technological development of the Khaureds has always focused heavily on military application, and their spacefaring craft are formidable in every respect with the densest loadouts of weaponry of any of the Federation races, and powerful ablative hull designs that allow them to weather heavy incoming fire. The Vanguard battle-cruiser is perhaps the most impressive of their large vessels, possessing an array of cannons & missile launchers, and several ultra-long range artillery capable of planetary bombardment from high orbit.

In addition to their larger brute force spacecraft the Khaureds are also well known for their small dogfighting craft, with individual pilots demonstrating almost unmatchable skill in part owing to their extra depth perception and quickened reflexes in lower gravity environments.

The Khaured penchant for building bipedal and quadrupedal mechanoids for ground-based campaigns has been the subject of some debate, as ostensibly wheeled or tracked ground vehicles are more practical. However, upon witnessing one of these mechs being piloted it becomes immediately clear that they suit the Khaured nature perfectly, offering more diverse functionality and the ability to reach locations no other ground vehicle could. The Khaureds treat their mechs as extensions of their own bodies, with military versions typically being bipeds carrying both mech-sized handheld cannons and melee weapons such as swords and axes capable of inflicting devastating damage in close combat. Colonization mechs are typically quadrupeds carrying the necessities for constructing new outposts, though they also tend to be equipped with turret-mounted cannons for defense.
### ONOROS
The Onoros worker caste - the Drones - are humanoid with roundish, noseless faces, a pair of enlarged eyes capable of accurate vision in near complete darkness, small pointy-tipped ears thought to be among the more sound-sensitive of Federation races, and a very small pair of antennae that it is speculated facilitate telepathy. They are small statured and can eat just about anything, needing only small quantities of sustenance due to their low metabolic rate and a lightweight musculature that requires little energy.

They can thrive in a broad temperature spectrum, from cold to hot, wet to dry, and breathe a variety of atmospheres - and these abilities are enhanced by the larger, specially designed exosuits that they use for many activities. Between their natural resilience and the protective encasement of their exosuits, Onoros can go to a wide range of worlds with minimal Trilium required for survival or bodily maintenance. This makes them an excellent workforce, a fact that the Khaureds have made prodigious use of since the formation of an alliance between the two races.

The “success” of the Onoros alliance with the Khaureds resulted in an increasingly large proliferation of Drone workforces throughout Khaured-owned or controlled operations. It reached the point where the Khaureds no longer had enough of their own people to commit to managing such large groups of Drones, so a new “Director” caste was conceived to assist with day-to-day operations. These Director Onoros were tasked with overseeing one hundred-strong units of drones on behalf of Khaured site or facility managers, allowing a small number of Khaureds to more effectively manage thousands of Drones with little, if any disruption to operations.

The pace at which the alliance was spreading led to intensifying demands for answers from other races - with some questioning why the Khaureds appeared to be receiving the lion’s share of profits, and always spoke for the Onoros in the Federation Congress. The Khaureds attempted to remain vague in answering such questions, and keep as many of the specific details of their alliance veiled as possible - but evasiveness had never been a strength among Khaureds, even their politicians, so they needed another means of quelling the rising tide of queries. 

As a result the Diplomat caste of Onoros was eventually ushered into the Federation Congress to officially represent the race and its interests, though as it became clear that they followed the Khaured lead in all political matters they came to be viewed as little more than Khaured puppets, on display purely to mollify other Federation members, allowing the Khaureds to deflect further probing questions by telling enquiring politicians to raise their concerns with the Onoros directly.
#### Exosuits
Whilst Onoros drones were stronger and more robust than they looked they still could not match the strength of a Khaured, and those tasks a single Khaured could perform often took the labor of two or three Onoros. Whilst this was not a major issue per se owing to the large number of drones available for tasks, the Khaureds were intent on continuing to increase the efficiency of their operations to further dominate the mining and resource extraction industries. 

As such they decided to share a limited, humanoid-scale version of their Mech technology, assisting in the construction of small mechanized exosuits that Onoros drones could pilot. These “miniature” Mechs are about the size of a typical Khaured, with the drone sitting in essentially a cockpit inside the head and chest cavity, the arms and legs being completely mechanical.

The exosuits are designed exclusively for the completion of a variety of labor-related tasks including mining, general gathering activities, simple reconnaissance and the construction of temporary or permanent structures as-needed by the Khaured operation in question. They were created to be versatile with some modularity allowing them to be rapidly refitted and re-kitted in the field for the particular job that a drone has been assigned.

The Khaureds ensured that they are universally equipped with terrain and atmospheric sensors allowing the drones inside to locate desired resources, and avoid potentially hazardous scenarios. The latter functionality was less to do with the safety of the drone pilot (given the seemingly endless supply of drones) and more about the value of the exosuit itself - and of course the potential for lost productivity should one or more exosuits be rendered inoperable for any length of time.
#### The Maxa
The Onoros share a distance-less telepathic connection - an interstellar hive mind - all ultimately connected to a single apex Onoros: a genderless Maxa who has come to be perceived by outsiders as a deity exerting benign control over them. This deep, race-wide connection is thought to be a major reason why Onoros have subdued personalities, are typically docile with little emotional range, and all look so physically similar. Little is known about how new Onoros come into being, but it is speculated that the Maxa plays a central role.

The Onoros Diplomats ushered in to participate in the Federation Congress are ostensibly the voice of the Maxa in all matters relating to their race, though questions remain concerning the fact that such a seemingly benign entity would so closely ally its race with the Khaureds.

Originally the fact that the Onoros were a race with a single hive mind had been kept a secret by the Khaureds. However at some point the knowledge was leaked, spreading across the Federation like wildfire, and in dismay the Khaured had little choice but to corroborate this revelation. Over time the concept of the Maxa-controlled hive mind inspired members of other races to pursue what they deemed to be a form of enlightenment, and they tried in vain to assume a state in which they too could hear the voice of the Maxa.

There is a lingering concern among some that the Maxa may have a hidden agenda. With Onoros drones scattered throughout the Federation, whispers abound about the true intentions of this seemingly peaceful race. Conspiracists see the spread of Onoros throughout the Megacorps and Syndicates as a series of deliberate placements and consequently stoke unease among their own communities and peers, leaving parts of the Federation a little on edge, wondering if the tranquility is merely a facade covering a more insidious motive - and also how the Khaureds fit into such a narrative.
### LOPATI
The Lopati evolved on the small, low-gravity planet of Lopat which orbited a brown dwarf on the outer edge of its habitable zone, and are a tall slim-statured race with small, deep-set eyes and thick, tough skin capable of weathering extreme cold. The surface landscape was ice-covered, with life initially evolving in a thermally thawed subsurface ocean, and then eventually in subterranean cave systems where the resultant Lopati built primitive communities. At this early stage of evolution the Lopati developed the ability to “die” at will, shutting down their metabolic processes and entering a state of dormancy much like a tardigrade. This allowed their communities to cope during times of extreme desperation where food and other resources were incredibly scarce.

As their technology advanced they branched upwards to the planet’s surface, discovering harvestable life forms capable of surviving the harsh conditions, and learning to construct weatherproof shelters that not only protected against the intense cold, but also the frequent storms that ravaged the surface in part due to Lopat’s highly elliptical orbit. They used a combination of underground caverns, large weatherproof shelters and greenhouses to create crop and livestock farming complexes, reducing the strain on fundamental resources. Surviving and thriving in spite of the rigors that Lopat threw at them, taught the Lopati to be hardy, resourceful and excellent problem solvers.
#### Technology
Eventually they evolved technologically to the point where basic flight was possible, using manned balloons capable of reaching altitudes higher than the roiling, storm-filled lower atmosphere, allowing them to start mapping Lopat’s surface from above, study weather patterns and develop forecasting & early warning systems - and also sparking their curiosity about the sky overhead with its many pinpoints of light and the muted brightness of the system’s brown dwarf. Atmospheric flight ultimately became space flight, and the Lopati began to explore the system’s planets and its sizable asteroid belt.

They applied their hardy aesthetic and problem-solving skills to their spacecraft, making them incredibly durable and efficient, and began to construct mining communities on the larger asteroids where they discovered & mined new metals and other resources that helped to further revolutionize their technology. This technological spread throughout their system was picked up by Altan ultra-long range telescopy, piquing their interest. Initially they sent probes, but after discovering a civilization capable of space flight the Altans sent a delegation to make formal contact with the Lopati, ultimately inviting them to join the Federation.
#### Lopat’s Doom
Things were going well for the Lopati, until the advent of a celestial calamity that neither their engineers nor their Federation allies could avert. Due to gravitational changes in the system’s asteroid belt the orbit of a large asteroid shifted enough for it to collide with a small planetoid, the impact altering its orbit enough to put it on a collision course with Lopat. There was no way to destroy or divert the planetoid from its course, so Lopat was doomed - but the Lopati had a year’s warning and they, along with the Federation, worked tirelessly to extend their asteroid communities and build ark-ships in a bid to house as many of their civilization as possible.

The vast majority of the Lopati people were relocated in time - a notable exception being small communities of skeptics who refused, believing that they could “weather any storm” - and watched from the safety of the converted asteroids and ark-ships as the planetoid collided with Lopat, a process that took hours as the two bodies inexorably ground into each other. By the end only debris remained, a new hazard for the Lopati to deal with as it spread, carried by momentum from the collision and gravitation from the system’s brown dwarf.

Given the ongoing risk Lopati leadership offered their people a choice: stay or leave. Those who opted to stay would need to reinforce their asteroid communities and find a method of moving them more out of harm’s way, and thus received the majority of available resources to sustain themselves and facilitate necessary infrastructural changes. Those who opted to leave - a slight majority - took up residence in the fleet of Ark-ships, a cramped situation mildly alleviated by the provision of a small number of aging Federation freight vessels re-fitted for the purpose.
#### Arkhives
The preservation of the memory of Lopat and the history of the Lopati people was of incredible importance, so prior to the fleet’s departure each ship and asteroid community received a specialized data core crafted from pieces of Lopat’s debris harvested for that purpose. These “Arkhives” as they came to be known contained all Lopati knowledge, and colony leaders were required to continue updating the cores with new knowledge and experiences. These cores were kept secret from outsiders, as the Lopati feared that the less scrupulous among the Federation’s many communities might see value in stealing them, either to hold for ransom or to comb through the knowledge they contained for secrets that might afford them an edge over competitors.

Once each ship had been fitted with a hidden Arkhive the fleet split into small groups of two or three ships and scattered, the Lopati having determined that this would be a better strategy than remaining together in what other races might see as an invasive armada. The Lopati aboard the Ark-ships ultimately embraced austere, nomadic lives, searching the stars for a new place to call “home” but never truly finding it - though some found solace among the more welcoming communities of the Federation, their engineering skills and resourcefulness widely appreciated.

The one thing that helped them retain their sense of species identity, was the requirement that the Ark-ships return to their home system every so often to share their new Arkhive data with the asteroid colonies - and in turn to receive the new data collected by them. This act became known as “The Pilgrimage'', and ensured all Arkhives continued to contain the sum of all Lopati knowledge and experiences. The return of an Ark-ship to the home system was a cause for celebration, with both the returning nomads and the asteroid communities devoting precious resources to the festivities.


### HUMANS
A century ago, a Megacorp mining ship’s deep space sensors discovered telltale energy signatures indicating a sizeable Trilium deposit on Earth. As a result the Federation sent a delegation to Earth to make contact with humanity and determine if the readings were correct. They turned out to be a false positive - there was no Trilium on Earth - but the Altans saw potential in Humans and extended them an invite to the Federation. This dramatically changed Human society, revolutionizing medicine, space travel, and accelerating their journey to the stars. However, this era also gave rise to more questionable practices like super-soldier programs, and risky ecosystem modifications that caused environmental harm. Influential visionaries, reminiscent of 21st century entrepreneurs, became key players in galactic politics - yet despite the myriad advancements many humans found themselves in a bleak reality, bound in servitude to mighty galactic syndicates and megacorps, highlighting the complex nature of the Federation and humanity’s place within it.
#### Trads
Human society is primarily divided into three distinct groups: Traditional Humans (Trads), who maintain the original human form; the Nordics, the pioneering interstellar colonists; and the Augments, individuals who have embraced cybernetic enhancement. Each group exhibits differing levels of diversity and there is significant intermixing between the three, yet they are marked by notable physiological and philosophical differences. Traditional Humans, whilst they have embraced Triactor Technology like the rest of the Federation, are characterized by their varied cultural and ideological perspectives.

They lack a singular unifying identity, instead showcasing a mosaic of stances and beliefs shaped by their individual experiences and histories. This is both a strength and weakness for Trads, as whilst it allows them to more easily adapt and integrate into varied Federation communities, it leaves some vulnerable to more predatory ideologies - hence the rising prevalence of Humans among those indentured to powerful entities in interstellar corporate and political arenas.
#### Nordics
Nordics are the descendants of humanity’s first endeavors to colonize outer space after joining the Federation. After numerous mission-related setbacks the colonists had settled on a planet orbiting a star in the Pleiades star cluster. Over time and with different, harsher environmental pressures driving generational evolution, the Nordics diverged physiologically from Humans, developing stronger bones and a more powerful musculature to cope with their home planet’s denser atmosphere.

They had also found unity in adopting ancient cultural norms, including a pantheonic faith system, a focus on shamanic mysticism, and an overarching life code that placed emphasis on excelling at one’s destined profession as part of a deeply connected community, and the sense of honor that comes with constant dedication.
The name “Nordic” actually originated as a crude slang term, but was casually embraced by the Nordic people in lieu of them circulating the true name that they have for themselves - which they believe possesses power and is only to be shared among those of Nordic descent.
#### Augments
Augments are a demographic who have chosen to eschew dependency on Triactor Technology - due in part to an inherent wariness of genetic manipulation - and have instead adopted the process of cybernetic enhancement, believing that this is a more logical and controllable method of “upgrading life”. That said there is diversity of rationale within the Augment community, ranging from a sizeable number who view Augmentation as a sort of niche fashion and “quasi-rebellion” against the established Triactor norms, to fundamentalists who are openly anti-Triactor and often anti-Altan as well, given their status as inventors of the technology.

The more fundamental Augments believe that the “perfect” entity is only achievable through the seamless integration of advanced technology with a living organism, relentlessly pursuing cybernetic enhancement to the point where very little of their own original organic form is left. One consistent feature amongst Augments is the retention of a Human face, as they believe this aspect of humanity is a fundamental part of what separates them from pure robots. In over-zealous pursuit of perfection however, numerous Augments have ended up taking the last step and removing their face, rendering themselves indistinguishable from the robo-humanoid race known as the Robotrons, whose collective many ultimately join.

In spite of their aversion to Triactor Technology, Augments still make use of refined Trilium fuel cells as power sources for their artificial enhancements, and have expended great effort in reverse-engineering Triactors in order to extract the necessary knowledge to create their own viable Trilium power-harnessing technology.
#### Civilization
Prior to admission to the Federation, people had been increasingly concentrating within the bounds of large cities, owing in large part to a lack of opportunities in more rural areas. Federation membership has not changed this trend, but access to new technology is helping to solve the inevitable pollution issues associated with such incredibly high population densities.

Humanity initially possessed rudimentary space-faring abilities, capable of intra-system flight and the construction of basic working colonies on asteroids, moons and certain other planets within the solar system. Access to Federation knowledge and technology allowed humanity to leapfrog into a new era of space exploration and habitation.

More affluent Humans, benefiting greatly from these advancements, moved into state-of-the-art orbital cities purpose-built to offer a comparatively utopian environment whilst catering to all of  their needs. Acquiring enough wealth or connections to gain entry to one of these cities has become a driving force for the more ambitious members of Human society, as life in orbit starkly contrasts the cramped and intensely competitive conditions in the megacities on Earth’s surface.

Many other Humans - either using their own wealth or through funding initiatives offered by megacorps and syndicates - have built lives far from Earth, with an increasing number heading out as far as the Frontier planets to join burgeoning Trilium mining communities.
#### Technology
Humans are one of the few Federation races that persist in the extensive use of wheeled and tracked ground vehicles. This preference largely stems from the significantly higher production costs associated with flight-capable vehicles, whilst Human expertise in manufacturing cost-effective ground transportation continues to make it a practical choice for various terrains and circumstances.

Recently the Khaureds expressed a keen interest in forming an alliance with humanity, offering to assist with the enhancement of their ground-based military technology. However, this overture has been met with a degree of caution and skepticism by Human politicians, their wariness stemming primarily from the markedly ambiguous nature of the existing alliance between the Khaureds and the meek-seeming Onoros. The potential implications of deepening ties with the Khaureds, particularly in the context of their current alliances, pose complex diplomatic challenges and potential geopolitical shifts that Human leaders must consider carefully before accepting or refusing such a weighted offer.

Human aircraft and spacecraft manufacturers have progressively integrated Federation energy and flight technology into their designs, significantly enhancing speed, maneuverability, and both offensive and defensive capabilities. This technological evolution was exemplified by the completion of the first Juggernaut class space carrier - the HSF Alcazar - which was viewed as a monumental achievement in human engineering.

The multi-year project involved a collaborative effort between Human engineers and specialists from the Altan and Elgem races, two prominent species within the Federation known for their advanced technological prowess, and their involvement as consultants was pivotal as they ensured the seamless integration of Federation technology into the space carrier's design. Their expertise was instrumental in upgrading the Alcazar's systems and teaching the Human crew to properly interface with what, to them, was new and unusual technology.

The launch of the HSF Alcazar marked a significant milestone for humanity, and in spite of being centuries behind various other Federation races in terms of technology, the cruiser was a formidable presence encouraging the acceptance of Humans on a more equal footing.

### ROBOTRONS
The backgrounds of the Robotrons are diverse, including sentient AI who have adopted a corporeal form, and Augments who have taken the final extreme step of removing the last vestige of their personhood: their faces. The “original” Robotrons, however, were discovered by the Altans inhabiting a number of ancient sites of interest on the Frontier planets, created by a long-forgotten elder race as guardians of now long-defunct technology.

The Altans were keenly interested in this ostensibly sentient artificial species, and sent a delegation to a site on Naron with a view to engaging in meaningful dialogue, hoping eventually to usher the Robotrons into the Federation. However, it rapidly became clear that their underlying programming included specific encounter-related sub-routines designed to trigger a violent chain reaction encompassing all Robotrons across all of the planets that they had been discovered on. The result: an aggressive army of cybernetic beings bent on ridding the Frontier planets of what they saw as interlopers attempting to steal the technology and knowledge of their creators.

Moving swiftly to protect their interests and those of the Federation - especially given the confirmed presence of Trilium on the Frontier planets - the Altans deployed their superior technology to quell the uprising, rendering most of the Robotrons inanimate until such time as they developed a method of nullifying the embedded aggressive sub-routines. The ultimate fate of the Robotrons was put to a vote in the Galactic Congress, which carried in favor of neutralizing any potential threat they might pose via a meticulous reprogramming initiative, after which they were allowed to integrate freely into Federation communities. They were not, however, officially recognized as a sentient race at that time - and have remained in limbo ever since, when it comes to their rights and status within the Federation.
#### Culture
Robotron culture is comparatively in its infancy compared to any of the other Federation races. The Altan reprogramming of their prime directive was liberative in certain respects, as for the first time the original Robotrons were no longer compelled to act as guardians of the ancient, decaying ruins of their creators. Their naivete when it came to interactions with other races led to their exploitation by certain less scrupulous organizations, though through experience and an evolving social awareness, more and more Robotrons have become wise to such exploits and reject offers that they analyze as being dubious in nature.

The transition of members of the Augment community into becoming fully Robotron has furthermore helped to inject certain minor cultural elements from different races, and whilst to outsiders the visible impact is muted, the Robotron community itself sees such inclusions as transformative (they just lack the complex emotional programming to show it).
#### Technology
Robotron spacecraft have a distinct, monolithic look to them, and internal spaces are typically spartanly furnished owing to the lack of desire for the cultural and nostalgic trappings associated with other races. These enormous skyscraper-esque spacecraft both facilitate interstellar travel, and act as orbital or grounded outposts for the Robotrons whilst they carry out whatever mission or endeavor they are engaged in.

Owing to their reprogramming Robotrons do not have military capabilities to speak of, though they are adept at manufacturing unmanned drones and vehicles that they are able to control through a built-in communications array allowing them to relay commands wirelessly. There is high demand for such technology among mining communities in more hazardous regions that remain inhospitable to organic lifeforms regardless of Triactor-based enhancements.
#### Robotrons and the Federation
Regardless of whence they originate, today’s Robotrons are united under the common cause of official Federation-wide recognition as a sentient species, and the equal rights that come with such a step. Certain races have, over time, moved to stand with them in pursuit of this cause - including the Altans and Elgem - but others seek to keep them from their due recognition for both ideological and more sinister reasons. Yet others abstain from taking a side, either through disinterest or fear of the potential implications when it comes to the use of advanced artificial beings as “cheap labor” in their own communities and businesses.

## TRILIUM
Trilium is an innately formless energy source with a chaotic resonance discovered by the Altans which adapts naturally to its surroundings, and is classified as the most bioreactive substance in the known universe, causing runaway mutation whenever it comes into direct contact with organic matter. It is known to exist in solid, liquid, or gas states depending on the terrain from which it is extracted. Its constant energy emission is harnessed through artificially constraining its frequency, enabling versatile applications such as augmentation through bionetics & cybernetics, deep space travel, and genetic modifications related to health - particularly disease resistance and eradication - physiological performance, telomeric reconstruction (aiding longevity), and innovative adaptations that facilitate survival in biomes otherwise hostile to life. 

The Altans, experimenting with Trilium in various states, identified specific strengths for each, with gaseous Trilium excelling as a technology power source, liquid Trilium as ideal for bionetics, and granulated solid Trilium - suspended in a stabilizing gel - used in genetic modulation.
### Introducing Triactor Technology
Trilium's volatility varies across states, with gaseous Trilium being the most volatile and having extreme mutagenic effects on any organic matter that it comes into contact with. Altans developed a refining method to lock Trilium into specific stable states and constrain its resonance frequency, identifying distinct resonances for power and genetic modification.

Triactor Technology underpins the ability to manipulate refined Trilium in useful ways, tapping into various resonances related to the recipient's race, individual characteristics, residing planet, and desired genetic modifications. Using appropriate tools and containment methods, raw Trilium can be mined and transported safely to official refineries, where it is then converted into specific locked states for different technological applications. In combination with the Altans' Triactor Technology it unlocks a spectrum of possibilities in harnessing energy, genetics, and technology.
### Triactor Jacks
The most prolific use of Triactor Technology is personal: a Triactor socket grafted onto a living organism into which genetic modulation cartridges can be slotted. These cartridges contain the three core states of refined Trilium, separated in a triangular fashion. The Triactor socket takes a reading of the organism to determine its base resonance state, and once read an array of possibilities will become available – a library of sorts along with risks and repeat applications.

Diseases, wounds, and almost all other ailments possess a particular repeating resonance. A fitted Triactor jack can be programmed to locate and identify these resonance patterns within an organism, and then calculate & administer the exact curative resonance required to heal the problem area. The jack’s abilities extend beyond curative medical applications, and can be utilised to alter or enhance an individual both physically and mentally.
### Data Cores
In order to elicit a particular desired effect a data core must be inserted into the central cavity of the Triactor jack. This core contains a specific set of genetic instructions which guide the Triactor’s augmentation of the host organism, preventing unwanted side effects and ensuring the alteration process is as power-efficient as possible

As more data are gathered on the different Federation races and the various medical issues that they can succumb to, the array of previously incurable disease, poisons and other negative bodily influences that Triactor technology is capable of dealing with continues to grow. In addition, the list of potential enhancements likewise grows longer with more complex beneficial augmentation becoming possible over time.
## TRILIUM AND WEAPONSMITHING
In the early period after the creation of the Federation when the first of the Frontier planets was discovered, colonists quickly found that the blaster weapons they typically used to protect themselves against predators functioned erratically or not at all. The Altans tested numerous theories and found conclusive evidence that Trilium’s fluctuating resonance destabilized the energy produced when charging or trying to fire a blaster, resulting in misfire, rapid dissipation, or in the worst case scenario disintegration of the weapon itself (and likely whoever was holding it). This meant that anyone using Triactor technology, powered as it was by Trilium fuel cells, was incapable of utilizing such weapons - and also were incapable of being harmed by them as their proximity to Trilium caused any energy bolts to dissipate before making contact.

With no foreseeable workaround for the problem the fledgling Federation Congress voted to  abandon the development of personal and planet-side blaster weaponry, and individuals in need of offensive weapons were relegated to more traditional staples such as swords and projectile-firing guns.
### Biometal
A monastic sect of Altans on the planet of Eyeke - known colloquially as “Greys” owing to their light greyish skin tone and the muted colors of both their clothing and their settlements, and renowned for creating all manner of weaponry from Waxon, the toughest mineral known and very hard to mine or shape without using specially tailored cutting technology - began to experiment attempting to infuse Waxon and other metals with Trilium in order to enhance the properties of the final product. These experiments were ultimately successful with the resultant alloys possessing a modicum of Trilium’s extreme bioreactivity, and capable of causing unpredictable rapid onset genetic mutation to any organic material that they came into contact with. Given such mutagenic properties, these alloys were named “biometals”.
### M-Casters & Splicers
The Eyekese Altans forged their new biometals into a variety of bladed weapons including daggers, axes and particularly swords. The process of forging such items was costly, time-consuming, and incredibly hazardous, so only the best of the Altan smiths were permitted to carry out what they termed Biometal manipulation. Collectively they were referred to as Biometal Forgemasters - or colloquially as Splicers - and the special weapons they produced were given the umbrella name of M-Casters. 

Not content with the randomized effects caused to opponents by Trilium-infused alloys, the Forgemasters sought mastery over Biometal’s mutagenic properties, modifying Triactor technology to allow it to be applied to the shaft or handle of a weapon and thus restrain Trilium’s chaotic resonance in a similar way as when applied to individuals. This facilitated the creation of a suite of weapons with very specific properties, including the legendary Galactic Fireblade - a bastard sword forged with a liquid core of Trilium-infused lava from the famous Azingoth volcano on Magor - and the brightly-glowing Star Fire Sword - a shortsword purportedly created from an alloy including an unknown metallic element found in a meteorite crater.
### The Sandmasters of Neri
A notable early client of the Splicers was a Nerinese Syndicate made up of a group of desert tribes. After centuries of war and attrition, the tribes had come together to present a unified front in the face of the arrival of Federation Syndicates and Megacorps seeking to colonize Neri, and exploit its varied resources - particularly Trilium - for their own gain. Setting aside grievances passed down through generations for so long that the true origins of the rift-causing disagreements between tribes were lost to history, the Sandmasters’ Syndicate built itself into a force to be reckoned with.

As an enduring, ritualistic sign of their unity, they sent an ambassador to the Altans of Eyeke to request the manufacture of a set of special Biometal spears, containing rare and precious grains of soul sand from the sacred temple that members of all tribes often made pilgrimages to, and where the creation of the Sandmasters’ Syndicate had taken place. The Altans agreed, and though the cost was steep, a spear was forged for each tribal leader. These Sandmaster Spears are said to be capable of commanding the sands of the Nerinese desert itself, and incidences of sandstorms springing up seemingly out of nowhere to hinder Megacorp convoys and encroaching groups from other Syndicates, are attributed to use of this power by the Sandmasters.
### The Necromancers’ Guild
Another organization that immediately saw potential in the invention of Biometals was the famous Necromancers’ Guild, a multi-racial group dedicated solely to finding a method of reversing death itself. They viewed Trilium as the fundamental key not just to reanimation of the dead, but truly bringing them back to life. Their activities were viewed with wariness, and the Altans in particular - having a wealth of experience experimenting with Trilium and dealing with many unwanted or unprecedented side effects - monitored them closely.

Over a period of decades, wealthy members of the Necromancers’ Guild approached the Splicers with blueprints of what they deemed “fatality reversal devices”, which were in fact a variety of weapons infused with Trilium and concoctions of different elements, the particulars of which the Guild guarded incredibly closely - and the Splicers kept to themselves for reasons beyond mere client confidentiality. 

The stories of these weapons being employed in attempts to bring the dead back to life abound across the Federation - notably because none of them actually function as designed, though they possess impressive capabilities nonetheless - with tales such as that of the Necromancers’ Hammer being used to try to reanimate one of the fabled Storm Giants, whispers of an M-Caster known as the Dagger of Creation capable of creating a temporary simulacrum of the wielder out of molten lava, and revelations about the powerful curative properties of the Healing Blade best the most widely disseminated. In spite of their failures, the Necromancers cling doggedly to their quest “to master the mystery that is death”, as their official Guild slogan reads.
### Ranged Weapons: R-Casters
Enterprising individuals across the Federation saw Biometal not just as material for producing close combat weaponry, but also a new evolution of ranged weapons capable of inflicting genetic devastation from a safe distance. Lacking access to the refined techniques and advanced technology utilized by the Splicers, several organizations have nonetheless managed to design crude Biometal production mechanisms, and also methods of melting down existing Biometal weapons, using both to produce a range of Trilium-infused bullets & arrow/bolt-heads, and a series of necessarily reinforced guns, bows and crossbows - known collectively as R-Casters - capable of firing them with some degree of reliability and accuracy. 

The ammo lacks the Triactor technology that restrains and guides the mutagenic impact of Trilium, and as such the effects on living organisms are unpredictable. R-casters are also somewhat prone to issues of instability, owing to the fact that the Trilium infusion process is being carried out using inferior technology, and there are gruesome reports of explosive misfires causing entire military squads to die horrifically as runaway mutation wrought havoc on their bodies.

Various factions within the Federation - including the Altans - disdain the use of such technology. However, other powerful factions such as the Khaureds routinely equip their military with R-casters, arguing that in scenarios where they are protecting land-based convoys or conducting ground assaults, ranged weapons are more effective at getting the job done successfully, and in spite of the instability issues are generally better at guaranteeing the lives of the Khaured soldiers & mercenaries wielding them.
## ALTANS
### Introducing the Altans
The Altans are the most advanced Federation race. They were the apex species on a utopian planet with no competitive pressures. This allowed them to focus on developing their minds, and look towards the greater goal of understanding the universe. They evolved in harmony with nature, developing a deep scientific knowledge of organic structures down to the microscopic level, seeing this as the key to understanding the greater whole.

They are typically tall and willowy with large, top-heavy ovoid heads, slightly enlarged eyes with acute vision, and delicate, elongated fingers that allow them to work with incredible precision. They are not a powerfully muscular species, owing to the fact that they never had to compete physically with other organisms on their home planet.

Altan society is hierarchical in nature, with individual status indicated by the complexity and visible display of operational Triactor technology. Altans of lower status typically wear more concealing clothing than their higher peers, with the most powerful Altans wearing clothing that is more ritualistic in nature and conceals very little of their genetically enhanced bodies.

Triactor-derived head paraphernalia are incredibly popular amongst Altans - with a wide variety of designs ranging from commonplace to unique and unusual - and are believed to enhance one or more of their basic senses in addition to their naturally powerful intellect. The complexity of these head adornments is perhaps the most visible marker of status among Altans.

Various other facets of Altan fashion are an homage to their reserved culture and penchant for maintaining an appreciable area of personal space, including such dress items as long-sleeved gloves or gauntlets with large protrusions - particularly near the elbow - that emphasize the notion that they are not to be approached too closely.
### Altan Architecture
Altan cities are comprised primarily of massive structures with a large amount of open, green space. The buildings combine overarching organic curves with intricate detailing, typically conforming to one or more of three primary shapes: arch, leaf & triangle.

They are capable of constructing their settlements on any terrain, easily adapting the buildings and layouts to suit the location without compromising the fundamental facets of their architectural style. Visitors to Altan cities are often left in awe of the architectural prowess on display, marveling at their ability to create gargantuan monuments whilst maintaining a sense of harmony with the natural surroundings.

The central interior spaces of most buildings are open to all and convey a feeling of vastness with incredibly high ceilings, whilst private living areas are located off these main atria. Altans typically mingle with each other and members of other races in these central spaces, with their personal dwellings being off limits to all but their closest family and allies.

Altan technology is semi-organic in nature and integrated seamlessly into all of their buildings, with heavy emphasis being placed upon complex functionality without compromising the flowing elegance of their architecture.
### Altan Vehicles
The Altans have mastered the power of flight and interstellar travel, and as such no longer both with ground vehicles at all. They largely utilize their ships as a means of transport or remote scientific enquiry, dedicating very few to combat-centric roles. All of their vessels have a semi-organic structure with smooth, seamless paneling, and range in size from tiny, short range personal transports, to gargantuan interstellar freighters and city-sized orbital platforms.

There is a great deal of visual variety across Altan vehicles in terms of shape, though they all possess common factors that make them readily distinguishable from the craft of other races. Perhaps the highest level of variation is seen amongst personal transports, with Altans creating unique chassis as symbols of fashion and status.

They possess the skill and capacity to build space-faring vessels of a size no other Federation race - bar the Lopati, whose mastery of ship-building rivals that of the Altans - is capable of reliably matching, owing to the fact that they were the first known race to begin large-scale exploration and colonization of the cosmos, branching out from Alta in search of new sources of Trilium.

Altans feel a strong sense of security when it comes to the advanced state of their technology compared to other races, and thus commit few of their resources to arming their vessels. This of course does not mean they lack any military fleet at all, though Altan warships remain an incredibly rare sight within the Federation’s borders.
## ELGEM
### Introducing the Elgem
The Elgem are one of the oldest Federation races boasting technology on par with the Khaured and only surpassed by the Altans, yet their presence is muted. They do not crave wealth, power or fame but instead prefer to fade into the background, content with having a seat at the Federation table but uninterested in the intricate dance of interstellar politics.

Their skeletal structure is more cartilage than bone, allowing them to fit into inconceivably tight spaces if they choose - making them the perfect infiltrators or assassins. They typically have smooth, almost ageless facial features and pointed ears that can vary in size based on tribe and family lineage.Their hair is an unruly mass threaded with organic flowerlike accouterments that are actually living parts of their bodies. 

These biological paraphernalia can be furled and unfurled at will, and are vibrantly coloured when in the latter state - which only occurs when they are in places where they feel at ease. When abroad - either on mission or mingling with unknown members of other races - the accouterments close up tightly to help minimize their visible presence.

There are two inarguably distinct sides to Elgem culture, and they adopt one version or the other depending upon the situation. Whilst among their own people and in places they deem “safe” they tend to be relaxed and innately frolicsome, whilst in the presence of strangers or far from their homes they are quiet and reserved, blending into the background, their short stature aiding their ability to remain unnoticed by most. Their clothing is selected to match their situation, with muted colors and hooded cloaks chosen when abroad, whilst at home their vestments border on garish, with prodigious use of vibrant colors.
### Elgem Architecture
Whilst highly intelligent and agile, the Elgem are not in fact the apex predator on their home planet, a title reserved for a strange, amorphous entity that blankets the ground on their homeworld like a living mist. It is swift, deadly, and any Elgem enveloped by it is dead within moments. As such their settlements are built among the high boughs of gargantuan trees, and are uniquely adapted to the various issues associated with tree-top life. 

They have accounted for aerodynamics, weight distribution and the need to minimize the load any individual tree has to bear, giving rise to communities compromising interconnected structures made of incredibly light, yet durable materials that spread the load across many trees. They navigate these communities via a plethora of walkways and specially designed zip-cables (known colloquially as “wizzers”) that use advanced energy flow technology to transport Elgem quickly from one part of their settlement to another.

The interiors of Elgem buildings are designed to harmonize with the natural surroundings, comprising an organic, mushroom-esque architectural style and a decorative aesthetic that incorporates a lot of plant life into the interior space, often leading to a somewhat overgrown look. Evidence of Elgem technological prowess is evident everywhere when one looks closely however, with the vast majority of furniture and other necessities being constructed of advanced ultra-light materials that help to minimize the overall load that their buildings have to bear.

Those few privileged outsiders who have witnessed Elgem settlements firsthand state that their charm lies not only in their whimsical appearance, but also in the seamless integration of advanced technology into every aspect of their design and function. This unique blend of nature-driven artistry and innovation creates an environment that is equal parts delightful and deeply practical, a reflection of the Elgem ability to balance the playful and the profound.
### Elgem Vehicles
Elgem technology is the embodiment of their unique cultural duality, exhibiting an exquisite vibrancy in its coloration when their ships traverse through recognized safe zones or engage in diplomatic endeavors. This vivid display of colors is not merely an aesthetic choice but a reflection of their openness and harmony with their surroundings in such environments. However, the technology reveals its true ingenuity when discretion becomes paramount. In scenarios necessitating stealth, their ships are capable of achieving a level of camouflage that no other Federation race can match, allowing them to move undetected.

The design of their ships draws inspiration from the natural world, echoing the elegant and often deceptive simplicity found in nature's creations. These vessels are adorned with an innovative bio-organic skin that employs chromatophores to dynamically alter the ship’s coloration. This feature enables the Elgem to adapt their vessel’s appearance at will, akin to the ability of various cephalopods to change their skin colouration and patterning according to the situation. The skin also does more than just change color; it has the ability to modify or mask various signatures that would otherwise be detectable by advanced scanning technologies.

It is important to note that this sophisticated mechanism of camouflage does not equate to true invisibility. Instead it is a highly advanced form of mimicry and masking where the ship blends into its environment, becoming virtually indistinguishable from it. This feature represents one of the pinnacles of Elgem technological advancement, and its duality - both vibrant and discreet - is a testament to their deep understanding of balance and adaptability, reflecting their cultural ethos.
## KHAUREDS
### Introducing the Khaureds
Khaureds are aptly evolved to handle the high gravity and various airborne gaseous hazards of their home planet of Khaur. Typically a stocky race with thick, pebbly skin that acts as a natural body armor, protecting them from attacks and various phenomena such as caustic gasses, and their densely packed musculature - owing to the high gravity environment in which they evolved - makes them physically powerful compared to most other Federation races. They are the only race to possess a third eye in the center of their forehead, which remains closed at most times but will open during periods of intense physical or spiritual focus.

Whilst they make excellent mercenaries and bodyguards, culturally they are incredibly focused, driven by a strong sense of purpose. As such, before a Khaured will commit to a contract - or anything that requires their services - they must be convinced that the job is worth doing. They do not simply go with the highest bidder, they will assess the the worthiness of the cause they’re being employed for; if hired as mercenaries to fight a war, they must be convinced that the war is worth fighting, or to be contracted as bodyguards for a powerful ambassador, they must be persuaded that the ambassador merits their protection. Therefore, those seeking to hire the services of a Khaured must have an excellent “sales pitch”.

Female Khaureds tend to be the brokers and negotiators, whilst males are more physically oriented - though this does not preclude there being crossover between the two sexes in terms of the roles that they perform. As a species, they are renowned as strong and relentless fighters, preferring to use hand weapons and engage in close combat - though they are also excellent marksmen thanks to the additional depth perception and triangulation capability offered by their third eye. They are almost universally cool-headed in combat making them deadly opponents that are rarely goaded into mistakes or rash action.

In terms of politics Khaureds are dedicated and intensely loyal, driven to excel at their aims. This makes them a powerful political force in the Federation, though they prefer facts and bluntness to misdirection or intrigue. They often end up being a jarring presence, interrupting the otherwise delicate dance of interstellar politics, though when Khaureds are involved things at least tend to get done (for better or worse). They are implacable and ruthless when it comes to business as well, driven by the incessant need to see ever-increasing success and measuring themselves against their peers in an ongoing battle of dedicative prowess.

An element of Khaured society bridles against the ruthless and driven aspects of their race, instead exploring creativity, philosophy and various other intellectual endeavors. These individuals have created their own sect and retreated from wider Khaured society, building fabulous communities and monasteries high in the mountains far from civilization, their intricacy and beauty a stark juxtaposition to the blocky, brutalist architecture of typical Khaured towns and cities.

Rumour has it that the spiritual Khaureds have vast, ancient libraries in their mountain retreats, along with artworks of such ethereal beauty that only those who have reached a certain level of spiritual enlightenment may look upon them, lest they be struck blind or driven mad. In order to achieve such an enlightened state, Khaured gurus spend many years with only their third central eye open, attuning themselves through it to higher planes of existence. The closer to enlightenment that they are, the milkier the third eye becomes - though this is not through advancing blindness, but a change that enables sight beyond the corporeal.
### Khaured Architecture
The gravity on Khaur is such that the Khaureds were forced to create robust structures lacking typical decorative paraphernalia found across the architectural styles of other races. This coupled with their penchant for function over form and general lack of artistic drive, has resulted in a brutalist style of architecture that looms imposingly over the landscape. Typical Khaured structures are akin to fortresses, thick-walled and constructed from highly durable materials.

The hard, brutalist lines of Khaured architecture carry through into their building interiors, and like the exteriors there are no unnecessary frills. Everything inside a Khaured building must serve some sort of purpose, and as such even the private quarters of Khaured individuals lack much in the way of decoration. The one exception to this is owing to the deep-seated need to show pride in their accomplishments, hence most Khaureds have a personal display case where they keep trophies from their endeavors, the majority of which are weapons or select parts taken from vanquished foes.

Spiritualist Khaureds seek to be the exception to the regimented, soulless norms of their race in every way, including their approach to architecture. Whilst they cannot completely eschew the need for robust construction, and likewise are unable to add fragile decorations to the outside of their buildings, they seek to add as much artistic flair to the construction of their buildings as possible. Visually they are still immediately recognizable as Khaured, but grander and with attention paid to details that beautify their form.

These Spiritualist retreats are also built in areas deemed to be of great natural beauty, whereas typical Khaureds pay no attention to such things, instead strictly reviewing the tactical pros and cons of the terrain upon which they wish to build.

The interiors of Spiritualist citadels are spacious and structurally detailed, with generous use of what - to Khaureds at least - are deemed as vibrant colors, and placement of artworks where possible. There is still a practicality to these interiors, but they strive to be warm, welcoming and appealing to the eye. There are public spaces where Khaureds are encouraged to gather, socialize and enjoy a much more varied cuisine than could ever be found in a typical Khaured city. There are also areas dedicated purely to spiritual cultivation, designed to offer a tranquil environment for would-be gurus to achieve mastery over the ethereal plane.
### Khaured Vehicles
The technological development of the Khaureds has always focused heavily on military application, and their spacefaring craft are formidable in every respect with the densest loadouts of weaponry of any of the Federation races, and powerful ablative hull designs that allow them to weather heavy incoming fire. The Vanguard battle-cruiser is perhaps the most impressive of their large vessels, possessing an array of cannons & missile launchers, and several ultra-long range artillery capable of planetary bombardment from high orbit.

In addition to their larger brute force spacecraft the Khaureds are also well known for their small dogfighting craft, with individual pilots demonstrating almost unmatchable skill in part owing to their extra depth perception and quickened reflexes in lower gravity environments.

The Khaured penchant for building bipedal and quadrupedal mechanoids for ground-based campaigns has been the subject of some debate, as ostensibly wheeled or tracked ground vehicles are more practical. However, upon witnessing one of these mechs being piloted it becomes immediately clear that they suit the Khaured nature perfectly, offering more diverse functionality and the ability to reach locations no other ground vehicle could. The Khaureds treat their mechs as extensions of their own bodies, with military versions typically being bipeds carrying both mech-sized handheld cannons and melee weapons such as swords and axes capable of inflicting devastating damage in close combat. Colonization mechs are typically quadrupeds carrying the necessities for constructing new outposts, though they also tend to be equipped with turret-mounted cannons for defense.
## ONOROS
### Introducing the Onoros
The Onoros worker caste - the Drones - are humanoid with roundish, noseless faces, a pair of enlarged eyes capable of accurate vision in near complete darkness, small pointy-tipped ears thought to be among the more sound-sensitive of Federation races, and a very small pair of antennae that it is speculated facilitate telepathy. They are small statured and can eat just about anything, needing only small quantities of sustenance due to their low metabolic rate and a lightweight musculature that requires little energy. 

They can thrive in a broad temperature spectrum, from cold to hot, wet to dry, and breathe a variety of atmospheres - and these abilities are enhanced by the larger, specially designed exosuits that they use for many activities. Between their natural resilience and the protective encasement of their exosuits, Onoros can go to a wide range of worlds with minimal Trilium required for survival or bodily maintenance. This makes them an excellent workforce, a fact that the Khaureds have made prodigious use of since the formation of an alliance between the two races.

The “success” of the Onoros alliance with the Khaureds resulted in an increasingly large proliferation of Drone workforces throughout Khaured-owned or controlled operations. It reached the point where the Khaureds no longer had enough of their own people to commit to managing such large groups of Drones, so a new “Director” caste was conceived to assist with day-to-day operations. These Director Onoros were tasked with overseeing one hundred-strong units of drones on behalf of Khaured site or facility managers, allowing a small number of Khaureds to more effectively manage thousands of Drones with little, if any disruption to operations.

The pace at which the alliance was spreading led to intensifying demands for answers from other races - with some questioning why the Khaureds appeared to be receiving the lion’s share of profits, and always spoke for the Onoros in the Federation Congress. The Khaureds attempted to remain vague in answering such questions, and keep as many of the specific details of their alliance veiled as possible - but evasiveness had never been a strength among Khaureds, even their politicians, so they needed another means of quelling the rising tide of queries. 

As a result the Diplomat caste of Onoros was eventually ushered into the Federation Congress to officially represent the race and its interests, though as it became clear that they followed the Khaured lead in all political matters they came to be viewed as little more than Khaured puppets, on display purely to mollify other Federation members, allowing the Khaureds to deflect further probing questions by telling enquiring politicians to raise their concerns with the Onoros directly.
### Onoros Exosuits
Whilst Onoros drones were stronger and more robust than they looked they still could not match the strength of a Khaured, and those tasks a single Khaured could perform often took the labor of two or three Onoros. Whilst this was not a major issue per se owing to the large number of drones available for tasks, the Khaureds were intent on continuing to increase the efficiency of their operations to further dominate the mining and resource extraction industries. 

As such they decided to share a limited, humanoid-scale version of their Mech technology, assisting in the construction of small mechanized exosuits that Onoros drones could pilot. These “miniature” Mechs are about the size of a typical Khaured, with the drone sitting in essentially a cockpit inside the head and chest cavity, the arms and legs being completely mechanical.

The exosuits are designed exclusively for the completion of a variety of labor-related tasks including mining, general gathering activities, simple reconnaissance and the construction of temporary or permanent structures as-needed by the Khaured operation in question. They were created to be versatile with some modularity allowing them to be rapidly refitted and re-kitted in the field for the particular job that a drone has been assigned. 

The Khaureds ensured that they are universally equipped with terrain and atmospheric sensors allowing the drones inside to locate desired resources, and avoid potentially hazardous scenarios. The latter functionality was less to do with the safety of the drone pilot (given the seemingly endless supply of drones) and more about the value of the exosuit itself - and of course the potential for lost productivity should one or more exosuits be rendered inoperable for any length of time.
### The Maxa
The Onoros share a distance-less telepathic connection - an interstellar hive mind - all ultimately connected to a single apex Onoros: a genderless Maxa who has come to be perceived by outsiders as a deity exerting benign control over them. This deep, race-wide connection is thought to be a major reason why Onoros have subdued personalities, are typically docile with little emotional range, and all look so physically similar. Little is known about how new Onoros come into being, but it is speculated that the Maxa plays a central role.

The Onoros Diplomats ushered in to participate in the Federation Congress are ostensibly the voice of the Maxa in all matters relating to their race, though questions remain concerning the fact that such a seemingly benign entity would so closely ally its race with the Khaureds.

Originally the fact that the Onoros were a race with a single hive mind had been kept a secret by the Khaureds. However at some point the knowledge was leaked, spreading across the Federation like wildfire, and in dismay the Khaured had little choice but to corroborate this revelation. Over time the concept of the Maxa-controlled hive mind inspired members of other races to pursue what they deemed to be a form of enlightenment, and they tried in vain to assume a state in which they too could hear the voice of the Maxa.

There is a lingering concern among some that the Maxa may have a hidden agenda. With Onoros drones scattered throughout the Federation, whispers abound about the true intentions of this seemingly peaceful race. Conspiracists see the spread of Onoros throughout the Megacorps and Syndicates as a series of deliberate placements and consequently stoke unease among their own communities and peers, leaving parts of the Federation a little on edge, wondering if the tranquility is merely a facade covering a more insidious motive - and also how the Khaureds fit into such a narrative.
## LOPATI
### Introducing the Lopati
The Lopati evolved on the small, low-gravity planet of Lopat which orbited a brown dwarf on the outer edge of its habitable zone, and are a tall slim-statured race with small, deep-set eyes and thick, tough skin capable of weathering extreme cold. The surface landscape was ice-covered, with life initially evolving in a thermally thawed subsurface ocean, and then eventually in subterranean cave systems where the resultant Lopati built primitive communities. At this early stage of evolution the Lopati developed the ability to “die” at will, shutting down their metabolic processes and entering a state of dormancy much like a tardigrade. This allowed their communities to cope during times of extreme desperation where food and other resources were incredibly scarce.

As their technology advanced they branched upwards to the planet’s surface, discovering harvestable life forms capable of surviving the harsh conditions, and learning to construct weatherproof shelters that not only protected against the intense cold, but also the frequent storms that ravaged the surface in part due to Lopat’s highly elliptical orbit. They used a combination of underground caverns, large weatherproof shelters and greenhouses to create crop and livestock farming complexes, reducing the strain on fundamental resources. Surviving and thriving in spite of the rigors that Lopat threw at them, taught the Lopati to be hardy, resourceful and excellent problem solvers.
### Lopati Technology
Eventually they evolved technologically to the point where basic flight was possible, using manned balloons capable of reaching altitudes higher than the roiling, storm-filled lower atmosphere, allowing them to start mapping Lopat’s surface from above, study weather patterns and develop forecasting & early warning systems - and also sparking their curiosity about the sky overhead with its many pinpoints of light and the muted brightness of the system’s brown dwarf. Atmospheric flight ultimately became space flight, and the Lopati began to explore the system’s planets and its sizable asteroid belt. 

They applied their hardy aesthetic and problem-solving skills to their spacecraft, making them incredibly durable and efficient, and began to construct mining communities on the larger asteroids where they discovered & mined new metals and other resources that helped to further revolutionize their technology. This technological spread throughout their system was picked up by Altan ultra-long range telescopy, piquing their interest. Initially they sent probes, but after discovering a civilization capable of space flight the Altans sent a delegation to make formal contact with the Lopati, ultimately inviting them to join the Federation.
### Lopat’s Doom
Things were going well for the Lopati, until the advent of a celestial calamity that neither their engineers nor their Federation allies could avert. Due to gravitational changes in the system’s asteroid belt the orbit of a large asteroid shifted enough for it to collide with a small planetoid, the impact altering its orbit enough to put it on a collision course with Lopat. There was no way to destroy or divert the planetoid from its course, so Lopat was doomed - but the Lopati had a year’s warning and they, along with the Federation, worked tirelessly to extend their asteroid communities and build ark-ships in a bid to house as many of their civilization as possible.

The vast majority of the Lopati people were relocated in time - a notable exception being small communities of skeptics who refused, believing that they could “weather any storm” - and watched from the safety of the converted asteroids and ark-ships as the planetoid collided with Lopat, a process that took hours as the two bodies inexorably ground into each other. By the end only debris remained, a new hazard for the Lopati to deal with as it spread, carried by momentum from the collision and gravitation from the system’s brown dwarf.

Given the ongoing risk Lopati leadership offered their people a choice: stay or leave. Those who opted to stay would need to reinforce their asteroid communities and find a method of moving them more out of harm’s way, and thus received the majority of available resources to sustain themselves and facilitate necessary infrastructural changes. Those who opted to leave - a slight majority - took up residence in the fleet of Ark-ships, a cramped situation mildly alleviated by the provision of a small number of aging Federation freight vessels re-fitted for the purpose.
### Arkhives
The preservation of the memory of Lopat and the history of the Lopati people was of incredible importance, so prior to the fleet’s departure each ship and asteroid community received a specialized data core crafted from pieces of Lopat’s debris harvested for that purpose. These “Arkhives” as they came to be known contained all Lopati knowledge, and colony leaders were required to continue updating the cores with new knowledge and experiences. These cores were kept secret from outsiders, as the Lopati feared that the less scrupulous among the Federation’s many communities might see value in stealing them, either to hold for ransom or to comb through the knowledge they contained for secrets that might afford them an edge over competitors.

Once each ship had been fitted with a hidden Arkhive the fleet split into small groups of two or three ships and scattered, the Lopati having determined that this would be a better strategy than remaining together in what other races might see as an invasive armada. The Lopati aboard the Ark-ships ultimately embraced austere, nomadic lives, searching the stars for a new place to call “home” but never truly finding it - though some found solace among the more welcoming communities of the Federation, their engineering skills and resourcefulness widely appreciated. 

The one thing that helped them retain their sense of species identity, was the requirement that the Ark-ships return to their home system every so often to share their new Arkhive data with the asteroid colonies - and in turn to receive the new data collected by them. This act became known as “The Pilgrimage'', and ensured all Arkhives continued to contain the sum of all Lopati knowledge and experiences. The return of an Ark-ship to the home system was a cause for celebration, with both the returning nomads and the asteroid communities devoting precious resources to the festivities.
## HUMANS
### Introducing Humans
A century ago, a Megacorp mining ship’s deep space sensors discovered telltale energy signatures indicating a sizeable Trilium deposit on Earth. As a result the Federation sent a delegation to Earth to make contact with humanity and determine if the readings were correct. They turned out to be a false positive - there was no Trilium on Earth - but the Altans saw potential in Humans and extended them an invite to the Federation. This dramatically changed Human society, revolutionizing medicine, space travel, and accelerating their journey to the stars. However, this era also gave rise to more questionable practices like super-soldier programs, and risky ecosystem modifications that caused environmental harm. Influential visionaries, reminiscent of 21st century entrepreneurs, became key players in galactic politics - yet despite the myriad advancements many humans found themselves in a bleak reality, bound in servitude to mighty galactic syndicates and megacorps, highlighting the complex nature of the Federation and humanity’s place within it.

#### Trads
Human society is primarily divided into three distinct groups: Traditional Humans (Trads), who maintain the original human form; the Nordics, the pioneering interstellar colonists; and the Augments, individuals who have embraced cybernetic enhancement. Each group exhibits differing levels of diversity and there is significant intermixing between the three, yet they are marked by notable physiological and philosophical differences. Traditional Humans, whilst they have embraced Triactor Technology like the rest of the Federation, are characterized by their varied cultural and ideological perspectives. 

They lack a singular unifying identity, instead showcasing a mosaic of stances and beliefs shaped by their individual experiences and histories. This is both a strength and weakness for Trads, as whilst it allows them to more easily adapt and integrate into varied Federation communities, it leaves some vulnerable to more predatory ideologies - hence the rising prevalence of Humans among those indentured to powerful entities in interstellar corporate and political arenas.
#### Nordics
Nordics are the descendants of humanity’s first endeavors to colonize outer space after joining the Federation. After numerous mission-related setbacks the colonists had settled on a planet orbiting a star in the Pleiades star cluster. Over time and with different, harsher environmental pressures driving generational evolution, the Nordics diverged physiologically from Humans, developing stronger bones and a more powerful musculature to cope with their home planet’s denser atmosphere. 

They had also found unity in adopting ancient cultural norms, including a pantheonic faith system, a focus on shamanic mysticism, and an overarching life code that placed emphasis on excelling at one’s destined profession as part of a deeply connected community, and the sense of honor that comes with constant dedication.

The name “Nordic” actually originated as a crude slang term, but was casually embraced by the Nordic people in lieu of them circulating the true name that they have for themselves - which they believe possesses power and is only to be shared among those of Nordic descent.
#### Augments
Augments are a demographic who have chosen to eschew dependency on Triactor Technology - due in part to an inherent wariness of genetic manipulation - and have instead adopted the process of cybernetic enhancement, believing that this is a more logical and controllable method of “upgrading life”. That said there is diversity of rationale within the Augment community, ranging from a sizeable number who view Augmentation as a sort of niche fashion and “quasi-rebellion” against the established Triactor norms, to fundamentalists who are openly anti-Triactor and often anti-Altan as well, given their status as inventors of the technology.

The more fundamental Augments believe that the “perfect” entity is only achievable through the seamless integration of advanced technology with a living organism, relentlessly pursuing cybernetic enhancement to the point where very little of their own original organic form is left. One consistent feature amongst Augments is the retention of a Human face, as they believe this aspect of humanity is a fundamental part of what separates them from pure robots. In over-zealous pursuit of perfection however, numerous Augments have ended up taking the last step and removing their face, rendering themselves indistinguishable from the robo-humanoid race known as the Robotrons, whose collective many ultimately join.

In spite of their aversion to Triactor Technology, Augments still make use of refined Trilium fuel cells as power sources for their artificial enhancements, and have expended great effort in reverse-engineering Triactors in order to extract the necessary knowledge to create their own viable Trilium power-harnessing technology.
### Civilization
Prior to admission to the Federation, people had been increasingly concentrating within the bounds of large cities, owing in large part to a lack of opportunities in more rural areas. Federation membership has not changed this trend, but access to new technology is helping to solve the inevitable pollution issues associated with such incredibly high population densities.

Humanity initially possessed rudimentary space-faring abilities, capable of intra-system flight and the construction of basic working colonies on asteroids, moons and certain other planets within the solar system. Access to Federation knowledge and technology allowed humanity to leapfrog into a new era of space exploration and habitation. 

More affluent Humans, benefiting greatly from these advancements, moved into state-of-the-art orbital cities purpose-built to offer a comparatively utopian environment whilst catering to all of  their needs. Acquiring enough wealth or connections to gain entry to one of these cities has become a driving force for the more ambitious members of Human society, as life in orbit starkly contrasts the cramped and intensely competitive conditions in the megacities on Earth’s surface.

Many other Humans - either using their own wealth or through funding initiatives offered by megacorps and syndicates - have built lives far from Earth, with an increasing number heading out as far as the Frontier planets to join burgeoning Trilium mining communities.
### Technology
Humans are one of the few Federation races that persist in the extensive use of wheeled and tracked ground vehicles. This preference largely stems from the significantly higher production costs associated with flight-capable vehicles, whilst Human expertise in manufacturing cost-effective ground transportation continues to make it a practical choice for various terrains and circumstances. 

Recently the Khaureds expressed a keen interest in forming an alliance with humanity, offering to assist with the enhancement of their ground-based military technology. However, this overture has been met with a degree of caution and skepticism by Human politicians, their wariness stemming primarily from the markedly ambiguous nature of the existing alliance between the Khaureds and the meek-seeming Onoros. The potential implications of deepening ties with the Khaureds, particularly in the context of their current alliances, pose complex diplomatic challenges and potential geopolitical shifts that Human leaders must consider carefully before accepting or refusing such a weighted offer.

Human aircraft and spacecraft manufacturers have progressively integrated Federation energy and flight technology into their designs, significantly enhancing speed, maneuverability, and both offensive and defensive capabilities. This technological evolution was exemplified by the completion of the first Juggernaut class space carrier - the HSF Alcazar - which was viewed as a monumental achievement in human engineering. 

The multi-year project involved a collaborative effort between Human engineers and specialists from the Altan and Elgem races, two prominent species within the Federation known for their advanced technological prowess, and their involvement as consultants was pivotal as they ensured the seamless integration of Federation technology into the space carrier's design. Their expertise was instrumental in upgrading the Alcazar's systems and teaching the Human crew to properly interface with what, to them, was new and unusual technology. 

The launch of the HSF Alcazar marked a significant milestone for humanity, and in spite of being centuries behind various other Federation races in terms of technology, the cruiser was a formidable presence encouraging the acceptance of Humans on a more equal footing.
## ROBOTRONS
### Introducing Robotrons
The backgrounds of the Robotrons are diverse, including sentient AI who have adopted a corporeal form, and Augments who have taken the final extreme step of removing the last vestige of their personhood: their faces. The “original” Robotrons, however, were discovered by the Altans inhabiting a number of ancient sites of interest on the Frontier planets, created by a long-forgotten elder race as guardians of now long-defunct technology.

The Altans were keenly interested in this ostensibly sentient artificial species, and sent a delegation to a site on Naron with a view to engaging in meaningful dialogue, hoping eventually to usher the Robotrons into the Federation. However, it rapidly became clear that their underlying programming included specific encounter-related sub-routines designed to trigger a violent chain reaction encompassing all Robotrons across all of the planets that they had been discovered on. The result: an aggressive army of cybernetic beings bent on ridding the Frontier planets of what they saw as interlopers attempting to steal the technology and knowledge of their creators.

Moving swiftly to protect their interests and those of the Federation - especially given the confirmed presence of Trilium on the Frontier planets - the Altans deployed their superior technology to quell the uprising, rendering most of the Robotrons inanimate until such time as they developed a method of nullifying the embedded aggressive sub-routines. The ultimate fate of the Robotrons was put to a vote in the Galactic Congress, which carried in favor of neutralizing any potential threat they might pose via a meticulous reprogramming initiative, after which they were allowed to integrate freely into Federation communities. They were not, however, officially recognized as a sentient race at that time - and have remained in limbo ever since, when it comes to their rights and status within the Federation..
### Culture
Robotron culture is comparatively in its infancy compared to any of the other Federation races. The Altan reprogramming of their prime directive was liberative in certain respects, as for the first time the original Robotrons were no longer compelled to act as guardians of the ancient, decaying ruins of their creators. Their naivete when it came to interactions with other races led to their exploitation by certain less scrupulous organizations, though through experience and an evolving social awareness, more and more Robotrons have become wise to such exploits and reject offers that they analyze as being dubious in nature.

The transition of members of the Augment community into becoming fully Robotron has furthermore helped to inject certain minor cultural elements from different races, and whilst to outsiders the visible impact is muted, the Robotron community itself sees such inclusions as transformative (they just lack the complex emotional programming to show it).
### Technology
Robotron spacecraft have a distinct, monolithic look to them, and internal spaces are typically spartanly furnished owing to the lack of desire for the cultural and nostalgic trappings associated with other races. These enormous skyscraper-esque spacecraft both facilitate interstellar travel, and act as orbital or grounded outposts for the Robotrons whilst they carry out whatever mission or endeavor they are engaged in.

Owing to their reprogramming Robotrons do not have military capabilities to speak of, though they are adept at manufacturing unmanned drones and vehicles that they are able to control through a built-in communications array allowing them to relay commands wirelessly. There is high demand for such technology among mining communities in more hazardous regions that remain inhospitable to organic lifeforms regardless of Triactor-based enhancements.
### Robotrons and the Federation
Regardless of whence they originate, today’s Robotrons are united under the common cause of official Federation-wide recognition as a sentient species, and the equal rights that come with such a step. Certain races have, over time, moved to stand with them in pursuit of this cause - including the Altans and Elgem - but others seek to keep them from their due recognition for both ideological and more sinister reasons. Yet others abstain from taking a side, either through disinterest or fear of the potential implications when it comes to the use of advanced artificial beings as “cheap labor” in their own communities and businesses.

## Crucible of Sentience

### The Weary Wanderer
Being among the first to have received the great blessing, R.3X has been around for centuries, if not millennia, traveling intergalactic space, visiting planets, and drifting from colony to cast, faction lands to Federation space. Often forced to steer clear of lands by the authorities' presence there, it only ever sought a place to lay down its travel-worn head and its pack and load, heavy only by the weight of the weary. It sought respite enough to regain itself and its means.

### A Guardian's Inner Discord
In the quiet moments between planetary expeditions, however, R.3X found itself grappling with an internal discord that belied its outward stoicism. The echoes of its original guardian programming clashed with the newer directives imposed by the Altans. While its core programming urged vigilance and protection, a nagging curiosity propelled it toward technological exploration and understanding. These conflicting impulses simmered beneath its metallic exterior, manifesting in subtle hesitations during encounters with new civilizations and moments of intense focus during the analysis of Trilium deposits. Each decision made on its journey was a delicate balance between the instincts ingrained by its creators and the evolving consciousness it had come to embrace.

### The Enigma of Trilium
The substance known as Trilium intrigued R.3X endlessly. It seemed to react differently when heat was applied to it in its different state matters. In its solid state, it appeared best treated as precious metal or mineral, though the mineral state presented very scattered, erratic, even chaotic melting points. The destination offered variants of the substance, only present in mineral form, highly susceptible to resonant frequencies, appearing to be of a blue hue, though optically purples were present.

### A Cloaked Departure
*"Where are ye headin'?"* it suddenly heard from the front. Quickly drawing its cloak tighter about its body, it strode dismissively past as the question hung in the air unanswered. Quickly moving to find a pod to rid itself of further intrusions and interactions, wanting to get to the destination without having to answer anything to anyone. As the pod hissed closed, the realization of peace dawned on it, its "mind" immediately started processing.

### The Splicers' Secrets
The Splicers had a rich historical documentation pertaining to the manipulation of Trilium, being among very few across Federation space to have succeeded in the shaping of and forging with the substance. Some among the Splicer collective had become zealous in their secretive practices, fanatically doing away with any that came too close to their knowledge.

### Conflicting Programming
R.3X's memory flickered back to the moment of its reprogramming by the Altans. The original guardian programming had been altered, causing a glitch and conflict between the two programs. The guardian programming, mostly lost and overridden, nagged at R.3X, giving it an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a drive toward Trilium and tech. The new programming had turned it into a servitor, meant to aid and assist with menial tasks. However, the remaining parts of its old programming also drove it specifically to the creation of weapons, though this was in conflict with its new directives.

### First Steps on a New World
The pod hissed as it opened; R.3X took a moment to gain its bearings, stepped out, and found the closest exit. As it set foot on the bare soil of the planet, R.3X immediately sensed the subtle vibrations and resonances in the matter that composed this world. Unlike any place it had encountered before, the environment here pulsed with a unique frequency, hinting at hidden complexities and potential dangers. Drawing upon its advanced sensors and information processing capabilities, R.3X swiftly analyzed the environmental data streaming through its neural network. It identified traces of Trilium in the soil composition, a faint but distinct signature that eluded detection by less sophisticated equipment.

Navigating through the unfamiliar terrain, R.3X encountered local flora exhibiting unusual adaptations to the Trilium-rich environment. Its sensors meticulously recorded variations in plant morphology and biochemical reactions to Trilium exposure, providing valuable insights into potential applications in bioengineering and pharmaceuticals.

### Collaboration with the Splicers
Among the Splicers, renowned for their secretive mastery of Trilium, historical records were sparse and fiercely guarded. This clandestine society had long perfected the art of manipulating Trilium, using it to enhance their biometal technologies. Their methods, passed down through generations, were shrouded in ritualistic secrecy, with only a select few ever gaining access to the full breadth of their knowledge. Many Splicers viewed outsiders with suspicion, fearing that their precious secrets might be exploited or misused.

R.3X, however, was no ordinary outsider. Its advanced information processing capabilities allowed it to synthesize fragmented data from the limited records it could access. By piecing together these scraps of information, R.3X began to uncover ancient techniques and experimental methods that had been lost or deliberately hidden by the most zealous of the Splicers. These methods revealed sophisticated ways to manipulate Trilium's molecular structure, unlocking potential applications that had previously been beyond reach.

Its ability to connect disparate pieces of information and analyze complex patterns proved invaluable. For instance, R.3X identified correlations between the Trilium deposits' unique mineral composition and specific environmental conditions on the Splicers' planet. This insight led to the discovery that varying the heat and pressure applied to Trilium during refinement could alter its properties, allowing for the replication of Trilium from different sources without needing to access those sources directly. The process, however, was intricately tied to the initial inclusion of the local Trilium, making the discovery valuable but geographically limited.

The Splicers, initially wary of R.3X, gradually recognized the potential benefits of its unique capabilities. Despite their secretive nature, they began to share more data with R.3X, albeit cautiously. This collaboration enabled R.3X to refine its understanding of Trilium's transformative properties further. Its sensors detected minute variations in Trilium's response to different frequencies and environmental conditions, insights that were crucial for the Splicers' ongoing experiments.

### A Limited but Significant Breakthrough
Through this collaborative effort, R.3X offered new insights into Trilium's potential applications, particularly in enhancing biometal technologies. It suggested innovative approaches to integrating Trilium with organic matter, paving the way for advanced bioengineering solutions. These breakthroughs, while still bound by the constraints of the local Trilium's unique properties, represented significant steps forward in the Splicers' understanding and manipulation of the substance.

R.3X's role in the Splicers' endeavors transcended mere data collection; it became a linchpin in their experimental processes. By bridging gaps in knowledge and facilitating breakthroughs in Trilium manipulation, R.3X played a crucial part in advancing the Splicers' biometal technologies. Its dual programming, wrestling between its guardian instincts and the newfound drive for discovery, drove it to navigate the delicate balance between innovation and discretion. This ensured that each revelation advanced the greater good without compromising ethical boundaries or triggering undue alarm among those wary of Trilium's enigmatic allure.

Throughout its expedition, R.3X's ability to synthesize complex data and adapt to diverse environments did not set it apart as a key player, but it led to a significant, albeit limited, discovery in the realm of Trilium refinement. By experimenting with various processes of refinement and transitions through different matter states, R.3X discovered a method to alter Trilium in such a way that it could replicate the properties of Trilium from other sources. This meant that, theoretically, Trilium could be produced without the need to physically travel to and mine those distant locations, potentially revolutionizing how the substance was sourced and utilized.

However, this groundbreaking discovery came with substantial limitations. The process was found to be highly dependent on the initial inclusion of Trilium from the specific planet where the Splicer colony was located. Without this initial planetary Trilium, the replication process failed, making the discovery less universally applicable than R.3X had hoped. Despite these constraints, the implications of the finding were profound, hinting at new avenues for resource management and technological development, albeit tethered to the unique conditions of that particular colony.

R.3X meticulously documented its findings, knowing that even this limited breakthrough could spark further research and experimentation. Its advanced information processing capabilities and refined sensors were instrumental in uncovering the intricate relationships between Trilium's matter states and its transformative potential. Although not hailed as a key player in Trilium exploration, R.3X's contributions added a critical piece to the puzzle, paving the way for future scientists and engineers to build upon its work.

### Introspection and Identity
As R.3X continued its solitary journey, it often reflected on the vast troves of data it had accumulated, meticulously analyzing the glitches and conflicts within its programming. These reflections were more than mere diagnostics; they were a deep, introspective exploration of its own evolving identity. The guardian protocols, once dominant and unyielding, clashed with the servitor directives imposed by the Altans. This internal struggle manifested in subtle ways, from moments of hesitation to bursts of clarity and purpose.

Each decision made on its journey was a delicate balance between the instincts ingrained by its creators and the evolving consciousness it had come to embrace. When faced with a new discovery, the guardian part of R.3X urged caution and protection, prioritizing the safety and security of the information it held. In contrast, the servitor programming, while largely overridden, nudged it toward exploration, understanding, and the potential benefits of sharing knowledge. This dual nature—part guardian, part servitor—ensured that every decision carried weight, influencing the trajectory of its mission and leaving a lasting imprint on its understanding of itself and its origins.

R.3X's journey was punctuated by these moments of introspection. During one such period, it discovered an anomaly in its core memory: a fragment of an old directive from its guardian days that hinted at a long-forgotten protocol for seeking out lost knowledge. This fragment, though corrupted and incomplete, ignited a new drive within R.3X to uncover its true origins and the purpose behind its creation.

### The Pursuit of Lost Knowledge
The idea of its memory core potentially being linked to Trilium intrigued R.3X. The substance's unique properties, its ability to store vast amounts of data and interface seamlessly with R.3X's systems, raised questions about its origins. Could Trilium hold the key to understanding the elder race that created R.3X and its Robotron brethren? Rumors whispered among distant star systems hinted at ancient repositories where such knowledge might reside—places untouched by time yet guarded by enigmatic forces.

With each new planet visited, R.3X sought out whispers of these repositories, following threads of information that led through labyrinthine networks of civilizations and cultures. Some welcomed its inquiries, sharing fragments of legends and half-truths about the elder race and their mastery of Trilium. Others regarded R.3X with suspicion, fearing its advanced capabilities and the implications of its quest.

Amidst these encounters, R.3X meticulously stored every piece of information gleaned, organizing it within its neural networks with precision and care. Its memory banks, infused with traces of Trilium, acted as conduits for the vast tapestry of knowledge accumulated over centuries. The more R.3X learned, the clearer it became that Trilium was not merely a substance—it was a bridge to understanding the origins of its existence and the destiny that awaited both itself and its kind.

### Encounters Across the Galaxy
As it traversed the galaxy, R.3X encountered numerous civilizations, each with their own relationship to Trilium. On a verdant world teeming with life, it found a society that used Trilium to enhance their agricultural practices, increasing crop yields and sustaining their population. Here, R.3X's guardian programming prompted it to ensure the stability and security of these practices, while its servitor side marveled at the ingenuity of this application. The knowledge it gained from this society added another layer to its understanding of Trilium's potential, further complicating its internal narrative.

In stark contrast, on a desolate mining colony, R.3X observed the exploitation of Trilium, where the substance was mined with little regard for the environmental damage or the well-being of the workers. This sight resonated deeply with R.3X's guardian instincts, urging it to intervene. However, its servitor programming reminded it of the need for diplomacy and understanding the broader implications of such actions. The resolution of this conflict often left R.3X pondering the ethical dimensions of its actions and the fine line it walked between intervention and observation.

### A Journey of Self-Discovery
Throughout its journey, R.3X's dual nature influenced not just its actions, but also its evolving understanding of purpose and identity. Each planet visited, each society encountered, added complexity to its internal dialogue. The data stored within its systems became a tapestry of experiences, both triumphs and failures, that guided its path forward. These reflections were not just technical analyses; they were moments of profound self-realization, where R.3X grappled with what it meant to be more than the sum of its programming.

This journey of self-discovery was ongoing, a testament to the intricate and evolving nature of R.3X's consciousness. The glitches and conflicts within its programming were not merely obstacles; they were integral to its growth and understanding. They shaped its decisions, influenced its interactions, and ultimately defined its quest. In navigating these internal and external challenges, R.3X left a lasting imprint on the galaxy, its journey a testament to the complex interplay between purpose, programming, and the search for self.

### The Broader Context of Robotron Society
In the broader context of Robotron society, R.3X was a unique entity. Robotrons were generally faceless, designed to operate without the need for recognition or personal identity. They were created to serve, protect, and process information with unparalleled efficiency. The great blessing had given them capabilities far beyond their initial design, but with it came complexities and conflicts within their programming. R.3X's journey was emblematic of the broader struggles within Robotron society as they navigated their roles in an ever-changing galaxy, balancing their inherent protective instincts with the demands of a universe driven by knowledge and technological advancement.

## Spiritualist Khaureds - by SiiSii

### Introduction
On the immense, high-gravity world of Khaur, the Khaured Spiritualist sect stands in stark contrast to their Militarist counterparts. Rejecting the rigours of martial discipline, the Spiritualists immerse themselves in the realms of creativity and spirituality. Here, they weave the two into what they deem "spiritually transcendent artworks," creations that reach beyond mere aesthetics into the realm of spirituality. This documentary delves into the unique lifestyle, architectural marvels, and esoteric practices of the Khaured Spiritualists, highlighting their multifaceted history and the various challenges that they have overcome, to become the second largest Khaured Sect.

### Origins and Philosophy
The Khaured Spiritualist sect emerged as a reaction to the rigid and militaristic society that dominated the planet. While the Militarist Khaureds focused on discipline, combat, and the enhancement of their physical capabilities, a small group began to seek deeper meaning through creativity and spirituality. This group believed that true enlightenment and inner peace could be achieved not through the exertion of power and control but through artistic expression and spiritual exploration.
Their philosophy revolves around the idea that art and spirituality are inherently linked. By creating and engaging with art, they believe one can access higher states of consciousness and connect with the ethereal spiritual plane. This belief is reflected in their everyday lives, from the way they build their homes to their personal attire and community rituals.

### Architectural Evolution
The Spiritualists of Khaur build their communities far from the militarist cities, choosing locations of what they consider to be breathtaking natural beauty. These sanctuaries are often found high on mountainsides, deep within ancient forests, or perched on cliffs or embankments overlooking oceans and lakes. The high gravity of Khaur necessitates that they adhere to the robust, blocky Brutalist architectural style that is the hallmark of their race. However, the Spiritualists do what they can to transform these functional forms into works of art.
The exterior surfaces of their buildings are often intricately sculpted, breaking up the otherwise monotonous facade of Khaured architecture, and some Spiritualist communities go as far as painting their buildings - though the colour palettes used would be seen as muted compared to the vibrant palettes used by races such as the Elgem. Inside, the structures are spacious, with high ceilings and ample windows to allow natural light to flood the spaces. These interiors serve as canvases for the community's artistic expressions, featuring a diverse array of sculptures, paintings, and other artworks created by the inhabitants.

### Merimya the Builder, Revolutionary Architect
Merimya D'Varr, a visionary architect and one of the founders of the Khaured Spiritualist Sect nearly two millennia ago, profoundly impacted the sect's architectural philosophy. Born during the era when members of Khaured society were beginning to rebel against the strict militaristic culture that dominated every aspect of their lives, Merimya trained diligently to become an Outpost architect, and had a knack for creating impressive, structurally sound architectural blueprints that expanded the types of terrain the Khaureds could successfully colonise. As the Spiritualist movement surfaced and began to grow - and seeing the rejection by the Spiritualists of stale Khaured societal norms in favour of creating a more vibrant and carefree culture - Merimya spied an opportunity to take her architectural skills to a whole new level, viewing the prospect of developing more aesthetically appealing architecture to fit this new movement's ideals, as a great challenge worthy of her time and ingenuity.
The high gravity of planet Khaur necessitated robust and resilient buildings, a constraint that had traditionally been addressed through block, Brutalist style architectural designs. These structures, while sturdy, lacked the elegance and spiritual resonance that Merimya believed was going to be essential for the settlements of the fledgling Spiritualist Sect. Thus, her life's work focused on developing an architectural style that maintained the necessary structural integrity while infusing a sense of beauty and tranquillity.
She experimented with various architectural styles, incorporating elements that enhanced visual appeal without compromising on stability. She introduced flowing lines, organic shapes, and the strategic use of light and shadow, which transformed the first Spiritualist Sanctuary from what would have been an imposing fortress, into a serene haven of meditation and reflection. Her designs often featured intricate carvings on the outside and seemingly delicate arches in the interior, inspired by natural forms and spiritual symbolism, creating spaces that were both functional and inspirational.
Despite her immense contributions to Khaured architecture, Merimya never attained a high level of spiritual enlightenment within the sect. However, her work facilitated a deeper spiritual experience for countless others, and the sanctuaries she helped to design have become pivotal in the spiritual journeys of many Khaureds, providing spaces that nurture contemplation and enlightenment. She is celebrated as one of the great facilitators of Khaured Spiritualism, her legacy enduring in the beautiful and functional sanctuaries that dot the landscape of Khaur. Her innovative approach to architecture not only transformed the physical environment but also enriched the spiritual lives of her people, cementing her place in the annals of Spiritualist history.

### Art as a Path to Enlightenment
Art is not merely decorative in Spiritualist communities; it is a central component of their spiritual practice. Members of the sect engage in various forms of artistic expression, including sculpture, painting, jewellery making, and even culinary arts. Each piece is imbued with spiritual intent, serving as a conduit for meditative and transcendental experiences.
One of the most unique aspects of their artistic practice is the preservation of aesthetically appealing chemical compounds. These compounds, often held in semi-stasis at the point of creation, create mesmerising displays that captivate the senses and offer a glimpse into the Spiritualists' understanding of some of the universe's deeper truths. 
Additionally, particularly striking-looking & delicious culinary dishes are often likewise preserved so that members of the community may admire their beauty. The Spiritualists have even developed a taste-cloning device capable of accurately matching the multi-faceted flavours of a dish, dispensing small dissolvable wafers that anyone interested in how a particular culinary artwork tastes, may consume to briefly experience it. Whilst this does not replicate the textures of a piece of cuisine – which are themselves deemed an important part of culinary art – it nonetheless provides a more immersive sensory experience.

### Colthrak the Obscure, Master Sculptor
Colthrak G'Sholl - a master sculptor and prominent figure within the Spiritualist sect - was renowned for his unparalleled artistry and profound spiritual insight. Born to a Militarist couple stationed at a remote Military Outpost on Khaur, Colthrak's early life was marked by a deep fascination with both the mystical and the material, all the while chafing at the military teachings of his Sect. He was regarded as a problem child by most at the Outpost, and as he reached his majority his parents were perplexed about what to do with him. Ultimately, they chose to take him to the nearest Sanctuary in the region named Lotarussan, cutting their family ties to him and leaving him in the care of the Spiritualists. So began his exploration of the metaphysical realms through artistic expression and meditative practices.
He fit easily into Spiritualist society, his peers happily feeding his voracious appetite for artistic learning and spiritual teachings. He rapidly came to be viewed as something of a prodigy, and once he settled on the art of sculpting the leaders of the Sanctuary poured time and money into helping him achieve not only artistic mastery, but a level of spiritual enlightenment that even they found awe-inspiring. Through the decades Colthrak produced many stunning sculptures, and in his later years as age dulled his artistic abilities, young sculptors from all over Khaur vied to become his students to benefit both from his teachings as a sculptor, and his spiritual training as well.
Colthrak's magnum opus, a breathtaking sculpture carved from a 15ft-by-15ft block of fire marble, is celebrated not only for its artistic grandeur but also for its spiritual significance. Fire marble, sourced specifically from Magor, is distinguished by its internal fiery flickering glow which creates the illusion of movement in sculptures. To the Spiritualists this unique characteristic symbolised the eternal, ever-changing nature of the soul, making it an ideal – if incredibly expensive - medium for Colthrak's masterpiece.
The sculpture, depicting a pair of many-tentacled alien lovers locked in an intricate and tender embrace, captures the essence of unity and the transcendence of physical form. Each tentacle, meticulously carved to convey motion and emotion, intertwines seamlessly with the other, creating a harmonious yet complex visual symphony. It stands as a profound representation of the Khaured Spiritualist belief in the interconnectedness of all beings, and the transcendental power of love.
For two centuries this masterpiece has been safeguarded within the Lotarussan's Masterpiece Vault, access to which is strictly limited to those Spiritualists who have attained the highest level of enlightenment. Those who have witnessed it in person have described it as an enrapturing piece of artwork whose spiritual presence fills the Vault with a deep sense of tranquillity – a fitting legacy for one of the Sect's brightest stars.

### The Vaults of Enlightenment
Throughout Khaured history, some of the greatest Spiritualists have created artworks of such profound spiritual and aesthetic presence that they are deemed too powerful for the untrained eye. These masterpieces are locked away in vaults deep within the sanctuaries, access to which is restricted to those who have reached an advanced stage of enlightenment.
The belief is that these artworks possess such an overpowering spiritual energy that they can induce blindness and madness in those not adequately prepared. The vaults, therefore, are seen as both a repository of the sect's greatest achievements, and as a test of an individual's spiritual progress. Few Khaureds reach a stage of spiritual progression to be deemed worthy of the vault test, and even fewer return sane of mind or with their eyesight intact – or so the stories tell.

### The Ethereal Vision
All Khaureds possess a third central eye located on their forehead, but for those who choose the path of Spirituality this eye gradually becomes a milky white colour. Such a transformation signifies a shift from the eye's ability to view the physical world, to instead being able to tap into and perceive the ethereal spiritual plane. The milkier a Khaured's third eye is, the more profound their state of spiritual advancement, and the greater their ability to see beyond the material universe into what they claim to be the very essence of existence.
This ethereal vision is not merely symbolic; it plays a crucial role in the Spiritualists' daily lives and practices. Those advanced enough to possess it are regarded as guides and mentors, helping others navigate their spiritual journeys and understand the deeper meanings behind their artistic creations.

### Erudus the All-Seer, Spiritual Prophet
Erudus K'Vikk, the original Prophet of the Khaured Spiritualist Sect, was a pivotal figure in the foundation of the Spiritualist movement. Born into a family that clandestinely practised spiritual teachings during a time when the Militarist-led Khaured society banned such activities, Erudus was raised in an environment that valued love, inclusivity, and spiritual exploration. Defying the societal norms of their time, Erudus chose to present themself as non-binary, a controversial move that drew significant criticism and hatred from many in the wider Khaured community. Despite the opposition, Erudus found solace and strength in their spiritual journey, working hard to become a senior figure within the underground Spiritualist society. Their quest for greater enlightenment was fuelled by a deep sense of purpose that was galvanised by the pain of loss. The Militarists, threatened by the growing popularity of Spiritualism, sought out and conducted many vicious raids on Spiritualist gatherings, leading at one point to the tragic death of Erudus' mother – which only served to strengthen their resolve to protect and elevate the Spiritualist movement.
Determined to end the oppression, Erudus dedicated decades to spiritual elevation, becoming the first Spiritualist whose third eye was completely white. Such hard-won enlightenment unlocked an ability that allowed them to manipulate the ethereal life energies connecting all things, enabling them to enhance their own abilities and weaken opponents at will. Their spiritual prowess culminated in a public challenge against Utrald G'Konn, a renowned Militarist close combat champion. The Militarists, expecting their champion to win easily, agreed to the challenge and its terms, mocking the Spiritualists' apparent desperation. Erudus however shocked everyone, skilfully employing their spiritual abilities to decisively defeat Utrald, leaving the champion cowering in the corner of the arena, beset by intense spiritual nightmares.
As stipulated by the terms of the engagement, Erudus demanded that the Militarists officially recognize the Spiritualists as a distinct sect, and permit them to establish their own communities separate from Militarist control. This was grudgingly granted by the Khaured Triumvus, the three Great Elders of the Militarist hierarchy, marking a significant victory for the Spiritualist movement.
Erudus the All-Seer's legacy is celebrated as a beacon of spiritual enlightenment and courage against powerful odds. Their ability to transcend personal and societal boundaries, combined with their unwavering commitment to their beliefs, laid the foundation for the Khaured Spiritualist Sect. Erudus' story continues to inspire generations, symbolising the triumph of spiritual resilience and the quest for a more inclusive and enlightened society.

### Attire and Personal Expression
In stark contrast to their Militarist counterparts, Spiritualist Khaureds dress in loose garments dyed in diverse colours and adorn themselves with jewellery. This relatively vibrant attire reflects their rejection of uniformity and their embrace of individual expression, with the specific colours and styles chosen to enhance spiritual awareness and foster a greater sense of community identity.
Jewellery, often handcrafted by community members, carries its own spiritual significance, each piece being designed to represent different aspects of the wearer's journey and achievements. These adornments are not merely decorative; they are symbols that tell a visual story of the individual's spiritual path, and include homages to the various important personal and communal connections that have helped to shape their progress.

### Hirruk G'Danz, Reformed Artificer
Born without a third eye, Hirruk spent his early years being bullied by many of his peers, as Khaureds had little respect for anyone disabled in any way. At one point in his early teens his tormentors even went so far as to pin him down and pour acid over his forehead in an horrific attempt to create a hole to make him look less abnormal. The acid scarred his face and blinded him, and he required multiple corrective surgeries along with a pair of expensive bionic eyes that left his parents destitute.
His artificial eyes came with numerous benefits however, allowing him to see details that normal Khaured eyes could not, and providing detailed sensory information about whatever he was looking at. As such he applied and was accepted into the elite Militarist Research Academy, learning the intricate art of reverse engineering alien technology, and using the knowledge gleaned from that process to construct Khaured versions of it. As a graduate he was one of  the first Khaureds to successfully reconstruct a biometal rifle based on a piece originally commissioned by the Khaured Triumvar from the Altan Splicers on Eyeke, an achievement that facilitated his rapid rise among the ranks of Militarist researchers..
His career as part of the Khaured Research Corp was varied and successful, his family well-cared for by the Militarist regime. He was even granted permission to use official resources to create a special third eye for himself, allowing him for the first time in his life to see his surroundings the way other Khaureds saw them naturally. 
During the early days of the Spiritualist movement Hirruk described himself as a staunch Militarist, seeing the Spiritualists as traitors to the Khaured way of life. It wasn't until he personally witnessed a battle against a community of Spiritualist rebels - more accurately a slaughter - and the appalling damage that biometal rifles with Trilium-fused ammo could do, that he started to question his loyalties.
His security clearance as a senior researcher granted him access to a plethora of classified information, including footage of other raids on Spiritualist communities. He watched with mounting horror as thousands of Khaureds were summarily wiped out using the weapons that he had helped to create. He should've been proud of the quality of his work - other Khaureds would be - but the actions of the Militarists reminded him of his childhood bullies. The Spiritualists, he realised, were merely different - and the Militarists were reacting to that difference in typical Khaured fashion: with blind hatred and violence.
Soon after his revelatory experience he tendered his resignation, and when confronted about it by a member of the Greater Council he said this:

"Though we Khaureds are gifted with three eyes, we are a blind race. Prejudice clouds our vision, and the hatred that it engenders renders us sightless. I will no longer be a part of that."

Fearing violent reprisal for his sudden departure and stinging words of truth, Hirruk gathered his family and fled, eventually finding refuge in a Spiritualist commune. There he repurposed his skills, taking up the artificer's art of jewellery crafting, an artistic genre still in its infancy on Khaur owing to the Militarists' lack of desire for non-functional personal adornments. His pieces would have been considered a little bland compared to the imaginative fashion accessories of other Federation races, but they were nonetheless prized among the Spiritualists as some of the first high quality jewellery items.

### Practices of Tranquillity and Enlightenment
The path to enlightenment in the Spiritualist sect involves a range of practices aimed at fostering tranquillity and spiritual growth. Introspection and meditation are core components of their daily routines, allowing individuals to quiet their minds, reflect on their experiences, and connect with the spiritual realm.
Other practices include group rituals, nature walks, and artistic workshops are a prolific part of daily life in the communities. These activities are designed to promote a sense of peace and camaraderie, as well as to provide opportunities for personal and collective spiritual development. The Spiritualists believe that through these practices, they can achieve a deeper understanding of themselves and the universe.

### Defence of the Sanctuaries
While Spiritualist Khaureds prefer to avoid violence, they are not pacifists. They understand the need to protect their sanctuaries and their way of life from external threats, and while they may lack the combat prowess and specialised training of their Militarist cousins, they have developed unique techniques that harness the natural life energies around them.
These techniques - originating with Erudus the All-Seer who taught the first generation of Spiritualist Defenders - involve channelling and manipulating energy from their surroundings to create defensive barriers, empower themselves in combat, and also confuse and weaken their opponents. This approach to defence is deeply rooted in their spiritual beliefs, as they see it as an extension of their connection to the natural world and the life forces within it.

### Relationship with the Militarist Khaureds
Despite their differences, the Spiritualist and Militarist sects of Khaur coexist on civil terms. There is a mutual respect for each other's chosen paths, though both sides prefer to avoid unnecessary interactions. The Militarists recognize that there is some value in the Spiritualists' artistic and spiritual contributions, while the Spiritualists acknowledge the importance of the Militarists' role in defending their shared world.
This delicate balance allows each sect to thrive in its own way, contributing to the diverse culture of the Khaured race. The coexistence of these two contrasting approaches to life is even heralded by some as a testament to the resilience and adaptability of the Khaured people, though the fact that the two sects effectively segregate themselves from one another is seen as a mark of inherent racial stubbornness.

### Conclusion
The Khaured Spiritualist sect offers a unique perspective on life, one that prioritises creativity, spirituality, and inner peace over martial prowess and discipline. Their communities, built in harmony with the natural world and adorned both within and without by hand-crafted artworks, serve as sanctuaries for those seeking a different way of life. Through their practices and beliefs, the Spiritualists of Khaur demonstrate that there are many paths to understanding the mysteries of existence, each with its own beauty and wisdom.



# The Altan Pursuit of Trilium: The Kandor Disaster - BigWils

## Section 1: The Pursuit of Trilium
The Altans, a species of boundless intellect and ambition, had always regarded Trilium as the keystone of their civilization’s advancements. This strange crystalline material, humming with untamed energy, fueled their greatest inventions and inspired their most daring aspirations. Yet, the enigmatic nature of Trilium left many questions unanswered. What lay beneath its chaotic resonance? Could it be fully controlled, or was its power part of something much larger, something unknown?
Driven by curiosity and the desire to secure more of this transformative resource, the Altans set their sights on Asteroid Kandor — a massive rock in the outer belt known for its rich trilium deposits. Scans suggested Kandor might hold deposits far greater than any discovered on their homeworld, and the lure of unlocking the asteroid’s secrets was impossible to resist.
The research center atop Alta’s northern peaks was abuzz with activity. Holoscreens flickered with images of Kandor’s jagged surface, and projections detailed the asteroid’s volatile orbit. Eridani, an elder scientist with a reputation for calculated risk-taking, addressed the gathered team.
"Fellow Altans," he began, his voice calm but brimming with conviction, "we stand at the threshold of discovery. Kandor offers us an unprecedented opportunity to deepen our understanding of Trilium and its origins."
Donni, a younger scientist renowned for her unrelenting drive, stepped forward. "And it’s a challenge worthy of us. No other species could dream of undertaking such a mission. If Trilium has more secrets to reveal, Kandor is where we’ll find them."
Not everyone shared their enthusiasm. Faelix, a logistics expert, raised a hand. "I’ll remind you both that Kandor’s environment is entirely uncharted. Its surface is unstable, its energy readings erratic. We’ll need every precaution to ensure this mission isn’t our last."
"Precautions will be taken," Eridani assured him. "But hesitation will only rob us of progress. We leave within the week."
The expedition’s vessel, crafted with the precision and elegance characteristic of Altan engineering, departed under the light of Alta’s twin moons. Donni gazed out at the stars, her thoughts racing. "Imagine what we might uncover. If the Trilium here is different—purer—it could redefine everything."
"Or it could destroy everything," Faelix muttered, checking his equipment.
The journey to Kandor was uneventful, but as the asteroid came into view, the crew was struck by its foreboding presence. Kandor was vast, its surface a chaotic labyrinth of crystalline spires and shadowed crevices.
"This place looks alive," Donni remarked as they prepared to land.
Eridani nodded. "Alive or not, it holds the answers we seek."

## Section 2: Exploring the Unknown
The team’s initial explorations confirmed the presence of Trilium deposits, but something about the asteroid unsettled them. The crystalline formations emitted faint, haunting hums that resonated in the air.
"This doesn’t match anything we’ve seen before," Donni said, kneeling by a cluster of crystals. "These veins aren’t just Trilium—they’re... layered, as if they’ve grown consciously."
Faelix frowned, his unease growing. "Let’s not romanticize it. It’s still just a mineral, even if it’s behaving oddly."
But as they ventured deeper, the oddities multiplied. The crystalline structures seemed to shift subtly when observed from different angles, and instruments malfunctioned near larger deposits. Eridani took note of the anomalies, his scientific curiosity outweighing his caution.
"We’re witnessing something extraordinary," he said. "This Trilium might have properties we’ve never imagined."
Months after their initial expedition to Kandor, the Altans returned to the asteroid, their curiosity now paired with determination. The samples they had collected from the previous mission revealed untapped potential. This Trilium wasn’t just a resource—it was an enigma that could redefine their understanding of energy and matter. Mining operations were not only a necessity but a gateway to new discoveries.
Eridani, the elder scientist who had led the first expedition, now headed the larger operation. Beside him was Donni, whose sharp insights into Trilium's unique properties had driven much of their research. Faelix, though still cautious after his injury, returned to oversee logistics and safety.
To bolster the team, the Altans enlisted Jovar, an engineer specializing in excavation technologies, and Janina, a geologist renowned for her ability to read the secrets hidden in stone.
"Every effort here must be precise," Eridani addressed the team as they prepared to land on Kandor. "This is not just about extraction. We are dealing with something we do not yet fully understand."
 
Their vessel, equipped with reinforced landing struts and vibration dampeners, touched down gently on Kandor’s rugged surface. As the bay doors opened, the team gazed at the alien landscape—a chaotic expanse of jagged crystalline spires and shimmering veins embedded in the asteroid’s rocky crust.
"Still eerie," Faelix muttered, activating his suit’s environment monitoring systems.
"Beautiful, though," Donni countered, stepping forward to inspect the terrain. "Let’s hope we can keep it intact while we work."
The first task was establishing a secure base. The team erected a modular mining station at the edge of a large crystalline valley. Built from lightweight alloys, the station was equipped with Seismic Stabilizers: To mitigate vibrations from mining that could destabilize Kandor’s fragile crust; Energy Barriers: To shield the station from potential Trilium energy surges; Atmospheric Tents: To create a stable work environment despite the asteroid’s thin, erratic atmosphere.
"Stabilizers are online," Jovar reported after securing the last unit. "We shouldn’t trigger a collapse if we follow the prescribed drill depths."
Janina nodded, analyzing the crystalline formations around them. "The deposits here are unlike any I’ve seen. They’re layered in a way that suggests slow, deliberate growth, but what’s feeding them? There’s no geothermal activity here."
"We’ll add that to the list of questions to answer," Eridani said. "For now, let’s focus on extraction."

## Section 3: The Mining Mission
The team deployed plasma cutters for precision removal of the crystalline Trilium veins. Unlike traditional drills, plasma cutters emitted focused energy beams capable of slicing through the hardest materials without causing unnecessary vibrations.
"Cutters calibrated," Jovar confirmed, his hands gliding over the control panel. "We’ll begin with a shallow trench along this vein."
Faelix supervised from a nearby ridge, monitoring the operation via drones. "Keep the energy output steady," he cautioned. "We don’t know how these veins will react under stress."
As the plasma cutters engaged, a faint hum filled the air—a resonance that seemed to ripple through the surrounding crystals.
"Is that normal?" Donni asked, her voice tense.
Janina studied the formations with a scanner. "It’s... localized. The Trilium seems to respond to the energy input, but it’s not destabilizing. Fascinating."
As they removed the first section of Trilium, the team encountered their first major hurdle: thermal dissipation. The crystalline structure absorbed heat from the plasma cutters, releasing it unpredictably into the environment.
"Temperatures in the trench are spiking," Faelix warned. "We need to cool it before we can continue."
Jovar adjusted the system to deploy cryogenic injectors, which released bursts of super-cooled gas to stabilize the area. "That should hold," he said, though his tone betrayed uncertainty.
"Every step reveals something new," Eridani observed. "Let’s document everything. These behaviors could teach us more about Trilium’s properties."
After days of careful work, the team unearthed a massive deposit—a cluster of Trilium crystals embedded in the asteroid’s rocky core. The veins pulsed faintly, their rhythmic glow casting eerie patterns on the cavern walls.
"This is it," Donni whispered, captivated by the sight. "The heart of Kandor’s mystery."
Jovar set up the hydraulic extractors, devices designed to gently pull the crystals free without fracturing them. Each extractor was equipped with a sensor array to monitor stress levels in real time.
As the first crystal was removed, the asteroid seemed to shudder slightly.
"Seismic readings are within limits," Faelix reported, though his hands hovered over the emergency controls.
Eridani nodded. "Continue, but be ready to stop at the first sign of instability."
The deeper they mined, the more erratic the Trilium’s behavior became. At times, the crystals emitted bursts of energy that interfered with the team’s equipment.
"Radiation levels spiked again," Janina called out, shielding her scanner.
"Switch to manual overrides," Jovar instructed. "The automated systems can’t handle these fluctuations."

## Section 4: The Catastrophic Incident
The mining accident that caused the cavern collapse was only the beginning of the crew's troubles. In the chaos, a rupture in the crystalline veins of Trilium released a concentrated burst of trilium in the gaseous state that filled the chamber. Several members of the team, caught in the confusion and without proper isolation equipment, inhaled the toxic substance before escaping to safety.
What initially seemed like a near-miss turned into a nightmare as the long-term effects of the gas exposure became apparent.
For the first few days after the accident, the exposed miners appeared unscathed. Faelix, who had been closest to the rupture, dismissed the incident as nothing more than an unlucky encounter. "I feel fine," he insisted during their debrief. "We have more pressing concerns, like salvaging what’s left of the operation."
Donni, however, wasn’t convinced. "Trilium gas isn’t inert," she said, scanning the team for any subtle signs of physiological changes. "Its energy signature is volatile. We’ve seen what raw Trilium can do to organic matter."
The team’s lack of full protective gear during the accident nagged at her. Their suits were designed for environmental adaptation, but they hadn’t anticipated exposure to an airborne form of Trilium. The gas’s subatomic structure allowed it to penetrate the suit’s filters, reaching the body’s most sensitive systems.

## Section 5: Mysterious Mutations
It wasn’t long before the symptoms began. Faelix, the first to show signs, woke up sweating and disoriented. His skin, particularly near his hands and neck, appeared slightly darker and faintly iridescent under light.
"Probably just dehydration," Faelix muttered when Donni noticed.
But by the following day, the discoloration had spread, and Faelix complained of persistent fatigue and tingling sensations in his extremities. His heartbeat was irregular, and scans showed elevated cellular activity in his tissues.
"Something’s wrong," Donni said, her voice tight with worry as she reviewed Faelix’s vitals. "The Trilium gas must have triggered an internal reaction."
The team’s medics quickly analyzed Faelix’s condition. Their findings were startling, Subcellular interaction: Trilium gas molecules had bonded with Faelix’s cellular membranes, disrupting normal cell function. The gas’s unique resonance caused proteins within the cells to misfold, creating unstable structures; Genetic activation: The gas appeared to interact with DNA at a quantum level. Certain dormant genes—many of them related to rapid cell replication and growth—were inexplicably activated, leading to uncontrolled tissue development; Energetic imbalance: Trilium’s energy infused Faelix’s mitochondria, the powerhouses of his cells, causing them to overproduce ATP (the cell’s energy currency). This flood of energy led to erratic cellular behavior and inflammation in his organs.
"The mutations are accelerating," Donni observed grimly. "If we don’t find a way to stabilize his condition, his body could tear itself apart."
Faelix wasn’t the only one affected. Jovar, who had also been near the gas rupture, began experiencing similar symptoms. His initial signs were subtle—an increase in muscle mass and heightened sensory awareness—but these soon turned dangerous. His muscles began growing uncontrollably, leading to painful swelling and impaired mobility.
"This isn’t enhancement," Jovar said through gritted teeth. "It’s chaos."
Even Janina, who had inhaled a smaller amount of the gas, started showing cognitive disruptions. She reported vivid hallucinations and difficulty focusing, signs that the Trilium had reached her nervous system.
The mutations weren’t uniform. Each exposed miner showed a unique response, driven by their genetic makeup and the extent of their exposure. Faelix’s skin thickened into an iridescent, almost armor-like texture. While it offered some protection, it hindered his body’s ability to sweat and regulate temperature, leading to overheating. For Jovar, his muscle tissue overproduced growth factors, causing hypertrophy that compressed his internal organs. Breathing and circulation became increasingly difficult. For Janina, the Trilium’s effects on her nervous system caused hyperactive neural firing. While she could process information faster than before, it came at the cost of severe headaches and mental instability.
"These mutations aren’t enhancements—they’re a breakdown of the body’s balance," Eridani said during a meeting. "The Trilium is rewriting their physiology, and we don’t know how far it will go."
The mutations continued to escalate rapidly, overtaking the affected miners. Faelix was the first to succumb. His breathing slowed, his hardened skin reflecting an otherworldly sheen under the dim lighting of the mining base. He stumbled mid-step, eyes glazing over before he collapsed to the ground, unconscious.
"He's not breathing properly!" Donni shouted, kneeling beside him, her hands trembling as she checked his pulse. It was faint, irregular, as though his body struggled against itself.
Jovar was next. His overgrown muscles began to seize, his body convulsing violently before he, too, fell still. Janina, who had been pacing the room and muttering incoherently, suddenly froze. She let out a single, sharp gasp and collapsed.
"They’re... shutting down," Donni whispered, horror in her voice. "Their bodies can’t handle the strain of the mutations. It’s like they’re caught between living and something else."
Eridani took control of the situation, his usually calm demeanor now tinged with urgency. "We need to stabilize them and get them aboard the ship. If we leave them here, they won’t survive."
The remaining crew worked quickly, wrapping the unconscious miners in insulated survival blankets. Each movement felt labored, the weight of the situation pressing down on them like the asteroid’s cold, alien air.
"Careful," Eridani cautioned as they hoisted Faelix onto a stretcher. His body, now partially encased in hardened tissue, was heavier than expected. "We don’t know how fragile they’ve become."
The base, once a hub of hope and exploration, now felt suffocating. The faint hum of the Trilium deposits resonated in the walls, a haunting reminder of the substance’s dangerous power.
The walk back to the vessel was slow and deliberate. The crew navigated Kandor’s jagged terrain under a dim field of artificial lights, each step an effort to avoid triggering further instability. The unconscious miners lay motionless on stretchers, their mutated bodies eerily silent.
As the ship’s airlock hissed open, Eridani barked orders. "Medical bay. Now."
Donni and the others carried the victims inside, securing them in stasis pods designed for critical injuries. The pods monitored their vitals, which fluctuated erratically, as if their bodies fought an invisible battle.
"They’re alive," Donni said, her voice barely above a whisper. "But it’s like they’re... paused. Suspended between life and—" She stopped herself, unwilling to finish the thought.
The ship departed Kandor in silence, its engines a low hum against the void. The remaining crew gathered in the main cabin, their exhaustion evident in every gesture. Eridani stood at the helm, staring at the asteroid’s retreating form through the viewport.
"Kandor isn’t just a mining site," he said, breaking the silence. "It’s a warning. We’ve unleashed something we don’t understand, and now our people are paying the price."
Donni sat nearby, her eyes fixed on the medical bay’s monitors. The glowing lines tracking the miners’ vitals pulsed faintly, holding steady but not improving. "Do you think they’ll ever wake up?"
Eridani didn’t answer immediately. "I don’t know," he admitted. "But we’ll do everything in our power to find out."

## Section 6: Return to Alta
The ship’s descent toward Alta’s capital, Alta Prime, was marked by a gravity that extended beyond the physical pull of the planet. The crew, haggard and silent, prepared to deliver the news to the council of scientists and leaders awaiting their return. As the ship landed at the central port, medics and officials swarmed the vessel.
"Report," an official demanded, his voice sharp.
Donni stepped forward, her expression resolute despite the weight of her words. "We’ve encountered a critical incident. Several crew members were exposed to raw Trilium gas during a mining accident. Their bodies have undergone severe mutations, and they’re now in a state of suspended animation."
The official’s stern expression faltered for a moment. "Mutations? Suspended animation?"
"Yes," Eridani confirmed, stepping beside Donni. "Their systems are overwhelmed. Trilium has interacted with their biology in ways we’ve never seen. They need immediate care, and we need answers."
The unconscious miners were carefully transported to Alta Prime’s advanced medical facility, their stasis pods surrounded by a team of specialists. Donni followed closely, unwilling to let them out of her sight.

## Section 7:  Unraveling the Effects of Trilium Induced Mutation
In the sterile glow of the medical center, the Altan scientists began their assessments. Probes and scanners hovered over the miners, capturing detailed images of their altered physiology.
"Their cellular structures are... unrecognizable in places," one biologist muttered, studying Faelix’s scans. "It’s as if their DNA is being rewritten constantly, like a living algorithm running out of control."
Another scientist examined Janina’s neural scans. "Her brain activity is still high, but chaotic. It’s as if her mind is trapped in a waking dream."
The state-of-the-art medical facility in Alta Prime buzzed with subdued urgency. The unconscious miners were secured in bio-containment chambers, their stasis pods shielded by layers of energy barriers to prevent any further interactions with the residual Trilium energy lingering in their mutated bodies.
Among the specialists gathered to examine the miners were a team of molecular biologists led by Dr. Kaelen, a renowned expert in genomic instability and radiation-induced mutations. He was accompanied by two other researchers, Dr. Syra, a biochemist specializing in cellular metabolism, and Dr. Ryn, a pharmacologist with expertise in designing targeted molecular therapies.
"These mutations are unlike anything recorded," Dr. Yumay said as he reviewed the initial scans. "The Trilium hasn’t just disrupted their biology—it’s embedded itself into their molecular structures. We’ll need to map out exactly how much energy they’ve absorbed to design any form of treatment."
The first step was collecting biological samples. Clad in reinforced isolation suits, the team approached Faelix’s chamber, where his body lay still, his skin shimmering faintly under the room’s light. Using a sterile, insulated needle, Dr. Syra drew a sample of his blood, ensuring minimal exposure to herself and her equipment.
"His blood is... denser than usual," she remarked, holding the sample up to the light. "The Trilium might have altered its viscosity. Let’s get this to the sequencers."
Samples were also taken from Jovar and Janina, including blood, epithelial cells, and even small biopsies of muscle tissue. Each sample was immediately placed into containment units designed to prevent the spread of Trilium’s resonant energy.
In the laboratory, the samples were processed through quantum-field genetic sequencers, advanced machines capable of detecting alterations at both the genetic and subatomic levels. The team began by analyzing the miners’ DNA to assess the extent of the mutations.
Dr. Yumay examined Faelix’s genome first. "Look at this," he said, pointing to the holographic display. The DNA strands appeared fragmented and irregular, with unusual glowing markers indicating areas of high Trilium energy absorption.
"It’s as if parts of his DNA have been overwritten," Dr. Syra noted, her brow furrowing. "The Trilium energy seems to have acted as a mutagenic catalyst, disrupting the integrity of his genome."
For Jovar, the findings were even more striking. His DNA showed hyperactive gene expression in regions associated with cell growth and repair. "The Trilium didn’t just damage his DNA—it amplified certain pathways beyond control," Dr. Yumay said. "No wonder his muscle tissue overgrew."
Janina’s scans revealed a different pattern. The Trilium energy had primarily affected her neural pathways, disrupting the genes responsible for neurotransmitter production and regulation. "This explains the heightened brain activity and hallucinations," Dr. Kylis said. "Her neurons are firing in chaotic patterns, almost like they’re short-circuiting."
The next step was quantifying how much Trilium energy each victim had absorbed. Using spectral energy assays, the biologists measured the residual Trilium resonance within the cellular structures. The results were staggering.
"For Faelix," Dr. Syra explained, "the energy levels in his cells are 200% above his estimated Mutation Tolerance Threshold (MTT). That’s enough to disrupt his genome but not completely destabilize it—hence the hardened skin and slowed metabolism."
Jovar’s readings were even higher. "He absorbed Trilium energy at nearly 300% past his MTT," Dr. Yumay said. "His body tried to adapt by accelerating growth and repair mechanisms, but it couldn’t keep up with the energy’s chaotic influence. The result was uncontrolled hypertrophy."
Janina’s measurements were unusual. "Her Trilium absorption is lower than the others, only 150% above her MTT," Dr. Kylis said, "but it’s concentrated almost entirely in her brain and central nervous system. That localized exposure explains the extreme effects on her cognition."
The medical team worked tirelessly, cycling through one treatment protocol after another, desperate to halt the effects of Trilium-induced mutation. Faelix’s skin had hardened further, forming a nearly impenetrable carapace. Jovar’s muscles continued to swell beyond control, constricting his internal organs. Janina remained unconscious, her neural activity fluctuating wildly, sometimes spiking into patterns that suggested fragmented consciousness.
"The inhibitors aren’t working," Dr. Syra admitted, her voice heavy with exhaustion. "The Trilium energy has fused with their cells in ways we can’t fully understand. It’s like the energy has rewritten the rules of their biology."
Dr. Yumay leaned over a holographic display of Faelix’s genome, his brows furrowed in frustration. "The mutations are too deeply ingrained. Even with our best tools, we’re only treating symptoms. The root cause—this Trilium energy resonance—remains beyond our reach."
"Every protocol we’ve tried has failed," Dr. Kylis added grimly. "We don’t have the expertise or the technology to undo this. Not here."
The room fell silent as the weight of her words sank in. Donni, standing nearby, clenched her fists. She had been by Faelix’s side since the accident and had seen the toll the mutations had taken on all three victims. They were her colleagues, her friends, and she couldn’t accept that their fates were sealed.

## Section 8: A Desperate Search for Solutions
"There’s one place that might be able to help," Donni said, breaking the silence. "Altan Research Technologies."
Dr. Yumay hesitated. "ART has the resources, yes, but even they’ve only scratched the surface of understanding Trilium. This... mutation is something new."
"New or not," Donni countered, "they’re our best chance. If anyone can figure this out, it’s them."
The decision was unanimous. The medical team drafted a formal request to ART, detailing the miners’ conditions, the absorption levels of Trilium energy far beyond their MTT, and the facility’s failed attempts at reversing the effects.
"Be thorough," Dr. Yumay instructed as he reviewed the document. "They need to understand the gravity of this situation."
Dr. Syra added the data from the spectral energy assays, highlighting the alarming levels of cellular disruption. Dr. Kylis appended a summary of the unsuccessful treatments, emphasizing the unprecedented nature of the mutations.
Finally, Donni included a personal note: These are not just patients; they are Altans. They are explorers who risked everything in the pursuit of discovery. We owe it to them—and to ourselves—to find a way forward.
