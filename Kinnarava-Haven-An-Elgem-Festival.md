Thousands of years ago, before the vampiric mists descended upon Velgemmis, the Elgem thrived on the ground. Their civilization was a vibrant tapestry of life, woven in harmony with the natural world. Vast forests stretched endlessly, their undergrowth rich with color and light, while rivers flowed like veins of silver, nourishing both the land and its people.
The mist came without warning, a crimson tide that seemed almost alive, snaking through the lowlands with a chilling sentience. It consumed everything it touched, forcing the Elgem to abandon their beloved homes. The ground, once a place of belonging, became a realm of fear. For the first time in their history, they looked upward, not in curiosity, but in desperation. Their survival lay in the treetops, where the mist did not reach.
The Elgem adapted, though the scars of their flight lingered. Their bough-settlements flourished over time, but the stories of the ground below never faded. To the young, these tales became myths, half-believed accounts of a life so foreign it felt unreal. Yet, for the elders, the memories remain sharp. They spoke of golden fields lost beneath the mist and of the songs that once echoed freely in the valleys. Each word carried a mix of pride for their resilience and sorrow for what was left behind.
In time, some sought escape beyond Velgemmis itself, going as far as moving to a new world, a colony world, Valinor. 
The Elgem had settled on Valinor, sometimes they would even visit their homeworld. They had made contact with other planets and races. Life was returning to how it once was. Children were born only to hear stories of Velgemmis. A distant world, still theirs and inhabited only that their kin lived in the treetops and could not descend because of the mist. Parents would tell bedtime stories to their kids of how the mist came, how deadly it was and the kids would be frightened to sleep but still felt comfort knowing they were far from any danger the mist presented. They would thrive here for decades, centuries even but just like Velgemmis, the mist came to Valinor.
The mist emerged slowly at first, then spreading like a living tide, it devastated their way of life. There were elders among them who experienced this very similar event on their homeworld but they were not as prepared as they should have been. Lives were lost. Forced to abandon their homes on the ground, once more, the Elgem fled to the trees. 
Through this cycle of loss and adaptation, one thing remained constant: the Verdant Crown. The ancient, towering tree became a beacon of survival, its blooms marking the seasons of plenty. It was said that the Crown’s resonance held the mist at bay, though few dared to test its limits. It stood as a reminder that while the mist sought to destroy, the Elgem’s spirit endured.

In their darkest hour, two elders, Serenna and Varonna became a beacon of hope to the Elgem. Serenna was a warrior, her resolve forged in the fires of necessity. When the mist first began its encroachment on Velgemmis, it was Serenna who led the effort to protect the settlements. Armed with a staff infused with the mysterious substance later known as Trilium, she stood between the mist and her people, holding the white haze at bay. The staff, shimmering with an eerie, iridescent glow, allowed her to channel immense energy, forming a barrier that shielded entire villages. But the power came at a cost. The Trilium pulsed with an unstable rhythm, and each use left Serenna weaker, her vibrant tendrils dulling and her movements growing more labored.
“She sacrificed not only her strength but also her spirit,” the elders would say. Serenna did not fully understand the risk but still chose to bear it, her eyes always fixed on the lives she sought to save. In the final days of the ground settlements, as the mist advanced in a relentless wave, Serenna wielded the staff one last time to carve a path for the Elgem to retreat into the trees. The effort drained her completely, and she passed away as the first bough-settlement was secured. Her staff, a symbol of her sacrifice, vanished shortly after her death, lost to the mists.
Varonna, in contrast, was a seer and a scholar, her connection to the natural energies of Velgemmis as profound as Serenna's bravery. While Serenna fought the mist, Varonna sought to understand it. She listened to its whispers and studied its movements, convinced that it was not merely a force of destruction but an integral part of the world's balance. Her visions, often dismissed as cryptic, spoke of a time when the mist and the Elgem would coexist, not as enemies but as parts of a greater whole.
It was Varonna who discovered the resonance of the Verdant Crown, the great tree whose blooms seemed to repel the mist. During a rare alignment of Velgemmis’ three moons, the Crown’s glow intensified, and Varonna received a vision, a symphony of light, sound, and balance. In her vision, Serenna appeared, her form aglow with the essence of the Verdant Crown, and together they guided the Elgem toward harmony with their environment.
“Serenna taught us to survive,” Varonna proclaimed, “but survival is not enough. We must learn to live in balance, to see the mist not as an enemy but as a part of the song.”
Varonna initiated the first Kinnarava Haven, a festival to honor Serenna's sacrifice and the resilience of the Elgem. The festival’s name, meaning "Song of Balance," reflected her belief that harmony between life and the natural forces, however harsh, was the key to enduring. Though she lived many years beyond Serenna, Varonna always spoke of her as a companion, one whose light continued to guide her.

The air was alive with color and sound. High above the ground, where the ancient boughs of the Verdant Crown stretched into the prismatic moonlight, the Elgem gathered. Their treetop settlement, usually serene and harmonious, was transformed into a kaleidoscope of vibrant banners and glowing petals, swaying gently with the breeze.
Tonight marked the first night of Kinnarava Haven, named such because in the old Elgem language Kinnarava roughly translates to “Song of Balance”. The festival is a celebration of survival, balance, and the enduring beauty of their existence above the deadly mist. The celestial dance of the three moons cast shifting hues through the canopy, their light refracting into ribbons that intertwined with the luminous glow of the blooming Verdant Crown.
Beneath the largest bough, the Seer Council stood, their robes shimmering with threads of moonroot silk. The festival had begun. All around, families whispered blessings as they carried delicate leaf lanterns, their soft light adding to the ethereal glow of the evening. The air hummed with expectation, resonating faintly with the Verdant Echo, a sound so low it was felt more than heard.
The Bloomlight Procession, the festival’s opening event, unfolds on the first night. Participants carry glowing leaf lanterns to the edge of the settlement, where they release them into the mist below. This ritual symbolizes unity and hope, connecting the Elgem to their ancestors and their homeworld and the unseen forces of the mist. The Verdant Crown glimmered overhead as Elgem of all ages gathered along the treetop bridges, each clutching a carefully crafted leaf lantern. The lanterns, fashioned from the first petals of the blooming Crown and imbued with bioluminescent oils, glowed with a gentle radiance.
"There is a hum tonight, soft but steady. The Verdant Crown blooms as it has for centuries, and our people gather once more under its protection. The moons sing their ancient harmony, casting their light upon us, but it is the glow of our people, our laughter, our lanterns, our spirit, that warms the night. This is Kinnarava Haven, the song of balance, the echo of life above the mist. It is not only a celebration but a remembrance, a renewal. I have seen it many times, and yet, each time, it feels as if I am seeing it anew." Erendil, an Elgem elder, spoke with such calmness in his voice. The Seer council gave him the honor of addressing the Elgem folk. Erendil was loved and respected among the Elgem folk. The children had grown even more fond of him because of his kind nature and especially his stories and folktales. One tale the children loved especially was “The Legend of Serenna and Varonna”. It was a tale Erendil told during the festival which takes place once every three years and lasts for three days, during the celestial event when the planet’s three moons align, casting prismatic light through the Verdant Crown as it blooms. This rare overlap of natural and celestial phenomena symbolizes balance and renewal.
As Erendil joins the procession, the atmosphere is alive with movement. Families, friends, and lone travelers carry glowing leaf lanterns, their designs as unique as the individuals holding them. Children’s laughter rings out as they chase glowing firebugs, their robes swirling in vibrant patterns. 
Erendil approaches a young Elgem, and his friends.
“Grandfather! Do you think Serenna’s light still finds the lanterns we send into the mist?” The young Elgem asks, excitement in his eyes and glee in his heart. Erendil smiles, his tendrils unfurling fully, a sign of trust and ease. “Her light guides every one. She watches as the Verdant Crown blooms, just as it did when she walked among us. Each lantern is a piece of our hope, and hope is never lost.”
As they near the edge of the settlement, the young Elgem clutches his lantern nervously.
“What if... what if the mist takes it? What if it disappears?” He says, scared this time. Erendil crouches beside him, his voice gentle. “Durin, even the mist cannot take what is given freely. The lantern will carry your wish, your hope, and your light. And someday, when the mist quiets, it will return to you in ways you cannot yet see.”
Together, they release their lanterns. Hundreds of glowing orbs drift downward, illuminating the mist in a breathtaking tapestry of light.
The group finds themselves in the heart of Kinnarava Haven, where the Echo Song ceremony is about to begin. Erendil leaves his grandson, Durin, to join the other elders. A massive, circular platform carved into the thickest branches forms the gathering space. The area glows with soft, shifting bioluminescent patterns that pulse like a heartbeat, reacting to the energy of the Elgem. As the elders step forward, the crowd quiets. Erendil raises his hand, signaling the start of the tale of Serenna and Varonna. The bioluminescent patterns beneath the elders morph into scenes that depict the legend. The visuals are abstract yet powerful, resembling moving constellations of light and shadow.
Durin and his friends sit cross-legged on the edge of the platform, their eyes wide with wonder. The legend unfolds, and they feel it as though they are part of it. The visuals tell the legend and even those who have seen it before are still fascinated. The legend serves as an intro to the echo song. 
The Echo Song is not just a performance but a communal act. Hollowed-out tree trunks produce deep, resonating tones. The sound isn’t just heard, it’s felt, vibrating through the platform and the bodies of the participants. The crowd joins the elders in humming a single note, their combined voices creating a harmonic vibration that lights up the platform in a ripple of colors. The Echo Song’s music is otherworldly, blending the natural and the mystical. The crowd’s voices weave together, creating a layered, echoing effect that seems to resonate through the entire settlement. As the song resonates, the elders fall into a trance-like state. As the song reaches its crescendo, the entire platform glows brightly, enveloping the participants in a radiant display. Floating orbs rise higher, scattering into the sky like shooting stars, symbolizing Serenna’s eternal presence guiding explorers through the mist. This act represents the Elgem’s collective hope and faith in the unknown.
After the Echo Song ceremony concludes, the crowd begins to disperse, their voices fading into the gentle rustle of leaves and the distant hum of lanterns. Durin lingers at the edge of the platform, staring at the mist below, his mind alight with questions. He feels a familiar hand on his shoulder and turns to see Erendil. The two find a quiet spot at the edge of the festival, away from the lingering crowds. The treetop paths are lit by soft, golden lights, and the distant sound of the Resonance Drums echoes faintly. Erendil sits cross-legged on a moss-covered bench, his posture both relaxed and regal.
Durin hesitates, then sits beside him.
“You stayed through the entire Echo Song. That’s a good sign. Many your age find it... tedious.” Erendil said, smiling. “I almost didn’t. But... It's different now. It felt like Serenna’s story was speaking to me directly.” Durin replied, grinning sheepishly. “Ah, the call of the mist. It stirs in many, but few are brave or foolish enough to answer it.” Erendil was studying Durin closely now. Eagerly, Durin asks. “Grandfather, do you think Serenna really became a guiding light? That she’s still out there, somewhere, watching over us?” Erendil paused, stroking his chin, he said “legends are strange things. They hold truths, but not always in the way we expect. Serenna may not be a beacon in the sky, but her spirit lives on in those who dare to seek the unknown. Perhaps that’s the light we’re meant to follow.”
As they sit together, the sounds of the festival fade into the night, leaving only the steady hum of the lanterns and the distant, mysterious whisper of the mist below.

As the second night of Kinnarava Haven descended, the settlement transformed into a realm of vibrant light and sound. The main gathering platform, a sprawling, circular space suspended between the largest branches of the Verdant Crown, was adorned with shimmering ribbons of moonroot silk. These banners reflected the prismatic moonlight, cascading rainbows that seemed to pulse in time with the faint Verdant Echo. The platform itself was a masterpiece of craftsmanship. Its edges were decorated with glowing orchiferns, plants that unfurled in soft luminescence under the moons’ light, casting an ethereal glow over the scene. Around the perimeter, they swayed gently, their tones harmonizing with the hum from the Verdant Crown above. It was here the Dance of Resonance was to take place.
The dancers, selected for their skill and devotion, wore robes made of gossamer-like fabric woven from spiral thread, a rare material harvested from treetop spiders. The robes shimmered with hues that changed with movement—blues fading into greens, purples melting into silver. Each robe was adorned with intricate embroidery representing different elements of Elgem culture: stars for hope, leaves for growth, and spirals for unity. Their flowerlike hair tendrils were decorated with tiny, glowing crystal shards, creating an effect as if their very essence was alight. Some dancers carried glowing staves tipped with small crystals, amplifying the harmony of their movements.
Erendil stood with the Seer Council at the edge of the platform, his elder’s staff planted firmly beside him. His robes, darker and more subdued than those of the dancers, bore the same spiraling patterns, symbolizing his role as both observer and guide.
The Dance of Resonance begins, a slow, deliberate movement that builds into a vibrant, synchronized display.
Each step of the dance tells the story of the Elgem. The rise of the mist. Their flight to the trees. The light of the Verdant Crown, and the balance they found here. It is not merely a performance, it is a prayer, a promise, and a celebration. The Verdant Echo joins in, its hum growing louder, as if the tree itself dances with them. The dance begins slowly, a single figure stepping into the center. Ceske, proud yet humble, moves with the grace of a falling leaf. His first step is deliberate, drawing all eyes to the heart of the platform. Each dancer joins in, one by one, their movements rippling outward like waves in a still pond.
The Dance of Resonance unfolded in layers. The performers moved in intricate patterns, their steps weaving a story of the Elgem’s journey: their harmonious life on the ground, the rising mist, their flight to the trees, and the balance they found in their new home. As the tempo increased, the chimes began to ring louder, their resonant tones vibrating through the air. The Verdant Echo deepened, as if the Crown itself was responding to the dancers’ energy.
As the dance reached its climax, the dancers leapt and spun, their glowing staves leaving trails of light in the air. The final movement was a unified spiral, the dancers forming a radiant helix before bowing deeply to the Verdant Crown. The crowd erupted into cheers and chants, their voices blending with the lingering tones of the chimes.
The dance had ended, and the platform hummed softly with the lingering tones of the Verdant Echo. The crowd had begun to disperse, their voices a gentle murmur as families made their way back along the bridges to their dwellings. Erendil lingered near the platform’s edge. Durin approached him, his flowerlike tendrils only partially unfurled, a sign of curiosity tinged with hesitation.
“Grandfather, can I ask you something?” Erendil turned, his gaze softening as he regarded Durin. “You know you can always ask, my boy. What stirs your thoughts tonight?” Durin sat cross-legged beside his grandfather, the glowing banners above casting shifting hues across his youthful face. “When I watched the dancers, I felt... something. Like the hum wasn’t just coming from the tree but from me too. Is that... normal?” Erendil chuckled, his tendrils unfurling fully, their colors deepening in the moons’ light, a sign of both pride and amusement. “Normal? Perhaps. But more than that, it is a sign that you are listening.” Durin tilted his head. “Listening? To what?” “To the song, Durin. The one that is always there, even in silence. The dance helps us hear it, but the song itself is woven into all things. The tree, the mist, the moons, even us. It is the song of balance.” Durin’s brow furrowed as he processed his grandfather’s words. “So... does that mean the tree sings because it’s balanced?” Erendil’s smile deepened, his eyes reflecting the glow of the Verdant Crown. “Yes, and no. The tree sings because it feels the dancers, just as you felt the tree. The song is not one voice, it is many. The moons above, the mist below, and us, moving between them. Together, we create harmony, even if we do not fully understand it.” Durin looked out toward the glowing canopy, his young mind turning over the weight of his grandfather’s wisdom. “Do you think... someday I’ll understand it too?” Erendil placed a hand on Durin’s shoulder, his grip firm yet gentle. “Someday, perhaps. But understanding is not always the goal. Sometimes, it is enough to feel it, to be part of it. That is what Kinnarava Haven reminds us.” 
The two sat in comfortable silence for a while, the soft hum of the Verdant Echo enveloping them. Above, the moons shifted slightly in their alignment, their light casting new patterns through the glowing banners.
In Durin, Erendil saw the questions of his people. He would grow, as they all do, seeking answers to the mysteries of the mist, the tree, and the balance they cherish. But tonight, it was enough for him to listen, to feel, and to wonder. That, too, is part of the song.
“Come, Durin.” Erendil said as he rose. “The third night brings offerings, and you will need your rest. The mist listens, just as we do.”
Durin followed his grandfather, the glow of the Verdant Crown guiding their steps.

On the third night, the mood shifted to one of quiet reflection. Families gathered at the edges of the settlement with their mist offerings. Each offering was unique, representing the hopes, memories, and wishes of its creator.
Erendil walked among them, offering guidance to the younger Elgem. "The offerings we release are not lost to the mist; they become part of it. Each light, each token, is a whisper to the forces that dwell below, a reminder that we are here, and we endure." He spoke as he has been doing throughout the festival. One by one, the offerings were released, their glow descending into the swirling depths. The mist seemed to pulse in response, a faint shimmer passing through it, as if it too acknowledged the Elgem’s gifts.
As the solemnity of the Mist Offering faded, the mood shifted as the atmosphere grew lively with the start of the Canopy Dash event. The main platform had been transformed into an arena of sorts, with obstacles, ropes, and wizzers crisscrossing above and below it. Banners of moonroot silk fluttered in the breeze, and the crowd gathered to cheer on their friends and family.
It was a daring race through the treetop walkways and zip-lines. The platform was alive with energy as Elgem of all ages gathered around the starting point. The spectators cheered and chattered, their robes and tendrils glowing faintly in the prismatic moonlight. Children climbed onto the shoulders of their parents to get a better view, while other Elgem folk moved through the crowd, offering trays of sweet, glowing fruits and flasks of Crownshine Nectar.
Erendil stood near the starting line, as he watched the participants ready themselves. Among them was Ceske, Durin’s friend, his youthful confidence tempered by a focused determination.
The Canopy Dash course began with a series of narrow branch walks, where participants had to balance carefully to avoid falling into the nets below. From there, they had to climb a vertical spiral of vines, cross a rope maze that shifted unpredictably with the wind, and finish with a daring zip-line descent that required perfect timing to land on the final platform.
Ceske adjusted the light, flexible harness he wore for the zip-line portion of the race, the iridescent sheen of his spiral thread robes catching the light. Durin darted up to him, excitement radiating from his unfurled tendrils.
“You’re going to win, Ceske! I just know it!” Durin yelled. Ceske grinned, crouching to ruffle Durin’s hair. “I’ll try my best, but you know it’s not just about winning, right?” Even though He and Durin were around the same age, Ceske had always seemed a bit older and more mature. Durin, nodding quickly, replies, “Grandfather says it’s about balance and harmony, but still, you should win!” 
Erendil approached.
“Durin is right about one thing, you have the spirit for this. Remember, Ceske, the Dash is not about speed alone. It’s about listening to the course, moving with it, not against it.”
Ceske nodded solemnly, though his grin betrayed his eagerness.
The Seer Council signaled the start with a melodic chime. The competitors leapt into motion, their movements a blur of color against the glowing backdrop of the Verdant Crown.
Ceske was quick off the mark, his nimble feet finding the rhythm of the branchwalks. Beside him, a competitor slipped, their foot catching on an uneven knot in the wood. The crowd gasped as she tumbled into the safety net below, laughing at their misstep.
“Go, Ceske! You’re in the lead!” Durin shouted.
At the vine spiral, Ceske encountered his first challenge. The vines were slick with condensation from the mist, and several competitors struggled to maintain their grip. Ceske paused briefly, testing the vines with his hands before launching upward with controlled, precise movements.
Erendil turns to a fellow elder, “See how he pauses? That is the wisdom of a true dancer, measured, deliberate.”
Reaching the top of the spiral, Ceske was met with the chaotic sway of the rope maze. The ropes shifted wildly with the wind, and two competitors ahead of him became entangled, their paths crossing at a critical juncture. Ceske hesitated, observing the movement of the ropes, then darted forward, using their small frame and agility to slip through a narrow gap.
Ceske muttering to himself said, “Move with the ropes, not against them... just like the dance.”
The final challenge was the wizzer descent. The line was set to wobble unpredictably to test the competitors’ control. Ceske clipped into the harness, his hands steady despite the pounding of their heart. The crowd held its breath as Ceske launched into the descent. The line wobbled sharply, but he adjusted, his body leaning instinctively with the shifts. The glowing final platform came into view, and with a perfectly timed release, Ceske landed smoothly, his robes billowing around them as he touched down.
The crowd erupted into cheers, Durin’s voice rising above the rest. “You did it! Ceske, you did it!”
As Ceske stepped off the platform, breathing heavily but beaming with pride, Durin ran to meet him, nearly tripping over his own robes in his excitement.
“You were amazing! Like Serenna herself!” Ceske laughed, hugging Durin. Erendil joined them, his expression calm but his tendrils unfurled, a rare display of pride.
“You listened well, Ceske. The course spoke, and you answered.”
Ceske bowed slightly, his grin softening. “Thank you, Grand Elder. But I think Durin here is the real champion. He cheered louder than anyone.”
Durin blushed and the three of them laughed as the next round of competitors prepared to take the course.

The third night of Kinnarava Haven culminated with the communal feast, a gathering that brought every Elgem, from the youngest child to the oldest elder, together beneath the Verdant Crown’s glowing canopy.
Long tables of intricately carved ultra-light wood stretched across the main platform, their surfaces decorated with spirals of glowing moonroot vines and small, fragrant blooms of the Verdant Crown. Overhead, the chimes of crystals swayed gently in the night breeze, their tones blending with the distant hum of the Verdant Echo.
The feast was a sensory masterpiece, reflecting the Elgem’s deep connection to their environment. Mist-Fed Fungi Stews, bowls of steaming stew, made from fungi cultivated on treetop terraces, filled the air with a rich, earthy aroma. The stews shimmered faintly, infused with bioluminescent herbs. Treetop Fruits, platters of brightly colored fruits, their translucent skins glowing softly, added a burst of sweetness and color. Crownshine Nectar, the festival’s signature drink, was served in delicate, flower-shaped cups. The luminous liquid emitted a faint warmth when held, its taste a balance of tartness and sweetness that left a faintly euphoric feeling.
Erendil sat at the head of one table, his elder’s staff resting beside him. Around him were Ceske, Durin, and other members of their family and friends, their laughter echoing into the treetops.
Durin, his plate piled high with fruits and a bowl of stew in front of him, turned to Erendil. “Grandfather, do you think Serenna and Varona would have enjoyed this feast?” Erendil paused, his tendrils unfurling fully in thought, their glow a gentle reflection of the lantern light. “I think they would have loved it, Durin. But more than the food or the lights, they would have loved seeing us here, together. That was always their wish—that we find balance, not only in the mist and the trees, but in one another.” Erendil responded rather carried away by thoughts. 
Durin considered this, his small tendrils fluttering.  “I hope they can see us now.”
Erendil smiled, resting a hand on his grandson’s shoulder. “Oh, I have no doubt they do.”
As the feast continued, the mood turned playful. Ceske regaled the group with tales of their adventures during the Canopy Dash, exaggerating the swaying of the rope bridge to great comedic effect.
“It wasn’t just swaying—it was practically doing a dance of its own! I thought for sure I’d end up in the mist!” Ceske said, telling everyone who was to listen. The group erupted into laughter, and even Erendil chuckled, his usual solemnity softened by the joy of the evening.
Later, Erendil rose, drawing the group’s attention. The conversations quieted, and all eyes turned to the elder.
"My friends, my family, my people. Tonight, we have shared more than food and drink. We have shared our stories, our laughter, and our light. This is Kinnarava Haven, not the lanterns, not the dance, not the offerings, but us. Together, we are the song of balance. The mist below and the moons above may challenge us, but they also remind us of who we are, a people who find harmony in every step, even when the path is uncertain. Let us carry this balance with us, not only through the festival but through every moment to come. For that is the gift of the Verdant Crown and the legacy of Serenna and Varonna."
The crowd erupted into applause, their tendrils glowing brightly in the celebration of Erendil’s words. As the night deepened, the Elgem began to drift back to their homes, the glow of the Verdant Crown guiding their steps. 
And so, Kinnarava Haven came to its close. But the song of balance, of laughter, light, and togetherness lingered in their hearts, a reminder that even in the shadow of the mist, the Elgem are never alone.
Kinnarava Haven ended that night as it always does, with laughter and light. Erendil stood alone at the edge of the settlement, gazing out over the swirling mist below. The soft glow of the Verdant Crown illuminated his features, casting shadows that flickered with the faint sway of the canopy above.
For a moment, he allowed himself to breathe deeply, savoring the peace of the festival’s end. Yet, there was a restlessness within him, an unease that had lingered since the Echo Song. The mist, always present but distant, seemed different tonight, alive with an almost imperceptible pulse that matched the rhythm of his thoughts. It called to him, a whisper beneath the steady hum of the Verdant Crown.
He stepped closer to the edge, his tendrils unfurling fully as though to sense the air. Below, the mist churned and shifted, its surface breaking with a faint, iridescent glow. Erendil’s breath caught. The light was subtle, a flicker at first, then a steady pulse, as if the mist itself were breathing. He leaned forward, his hands gripping the mossy railing of the treetop path.
“It cannot be…” he murmured, his voice barely audible over the faint rustle of leaves.
The glow intensified, swirling like liquid fire beneath the roots of the ancient tree. Memories surged unbidden—stories of Serenna’s staff, of Trilium’s strange, volatile power, of its allure and its cost. Erendil’s chest tightened. The elders had always warned of its danger, of the mutations it caused, of how it had drained the life from Serenna herself. And yet, here it was, unmistakable and alive, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath the mist.
As he stared, a sudden wave of dizziness washed over him. The glow seemed to rise, not physically but in his mind, resonating with the Verdant Echo and filling his thoughts with a strange, melodic hum. Images flashed before him: Serenna, standing at the edge of a crimson tide; Varonna, her hands raised toward the Verdant Crown; and something else, something formless yet vast, watching from within the mist.
The word slipped from his lips as if carried by another’s voice, He whispered, “Trilium.”
